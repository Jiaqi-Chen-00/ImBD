The campaign also has the backing of the area's MP, Chancellor George Osborne. Cheshire West and Chester Council said a feasibility study would start soon. The Winnington Turn Bridge, which is part of the A533 between Northwich and the M56, is a Grade II listed structure and was one of the earliest swing bridges in Britain to have electric power. Vehicles can cross from both directions, but Dilys Hooper, the chairman of Barnton Parish Council, says waiting times of 40 minutes are common during rush hour in term time. \"It's just sheer mayhem, completely. It's a case of who can get across the bridge first,\" she said. Land across Northwich has been earmarked for at least 4,300 new homes.

Caroline De Wolf, of the Antwerp World Diamond Centre, estimated the haul at $50m, saying: \"What we are talking about is obviously a gigantic sum.\" Earlier reports suggested the figure was even higher - with the Belgian state broadcaster reportedly putting it at 350m euros ($468m).

The court heard how Kelly had previously been a support worker for Ms Beattie, who suffered from a number of medical conditions including seizures. The divorced mother and Kelly later became friends and often socialised together.

Gray suffered a severe spinal cord injury in police custody in April and died a week later. His death sparked weeks of protests and later riots and looting in Baltimore. \"As is often the case, during an ongoing investigation, charges can and should be revised based upon the evidence,\" Ms Mosby said. The grand jury did not return charges on the false imprisonment charges that were brought against some of the officers. Ms Mosby brought the false imprisonment charges earlier claiming that Gray's arrest was unjustified and illegal. However, the grand jury did return new reckless endangerment charges that were not part of the original charges announced three weeks ago. Ms Mosby has said that Gray's neck was broken while he was being handcuffed and placed into a police van.

Last year the government announced plans to allow parents to share their maternity and paternity leave - changes are scheduled to come in April 2015. But the ILM said its research suggested the changes would have little impact if attitudes of employers were not addressed as well. \"The introduction of shared parental leave is a crucial step towards enabling more women to progress into senior roles,\" said Charles Elvin, ILM chief executive. \"Yet our research revealed cultural barriers are impeding the uptake of both two weeks statutory paternity leave and additional paternity leave.\" He said there remained a \"cultural expectation\" within organisations that women rather than men will be the ones", "Four people were on board the Irish Coastguard Rescue Helicopter 116 when it went down on 14 March.

She said the figures were virtually the same, but just calculated differently. George Osborne was sharing a panel with Ms Lagarde and German finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble when she made the remarks. \"Generally in any election year, the teams that provide the hypotheticals on which future deficits are forecast, err on the side of caution and assume that whatever is announced is not necessarily or inevitably going to happen,\" she said. Ms Lagarde added that the UK authorities had managed to provide the right balance of spending cuts and revenue raising. \"It's clearly also delivering results, because when we look at the comparative growth rates delivered by various countries in Europe,", "Transport for London (TfL) is to consult on plans to demand a new English language test, a map-reading assessment, a fixed landline and the chance to book seven days in advance. Uber said: \"If adopted these [rules] would mean an end to the Uber people know and love.\" Black cab drivers have argued regulations need to be tightened. There has been growing pressure on city legislators, most recently when cab drivers protested outside City Hall. The Uber app connects customers and nearby drivers using GPS technology and gives an estimate of the fare. It generally charges lower fares than traditional firms and drivers rely on technology for navigation. Transactions are cashless using pre-registered bank details. TfL says the consultation seeks to \"raise standards across the industry\" following an \"exponential\" growth in the private hire industry and technology. Uber said it was a deliberate target and if the proposals went ahead they would raise prices and increase congestion", "They spend an average of \u00c2\u00a3581 a year on music festivals, often opting for VIP passes or upgraded camping options. Predominantly male, the \"superfans\" are also more likely than most consumers to buy music on CD or as downloads. The results came from a survey of 504 UK residents, who had attended at least one festival in the last year. According to ticketing website Eventbrite, which commissioned the survey, these \"superfans\" help to \"drive the music festivals market\", often recommending music and events to their friends. They account for 28% of the festival-going audience, and more than half of them (54%) say they would be willing to attend an event alone. On average, they spend \u00c2\u00a345 more per event than a casual fan, but their loyalty is not guaranteed: 46% say that festivals are becoming \"too corporate\".

Its skipper said at the time his crew were lucky to escape unharmed, and the damage would cost about \u00c2\u00a310,000 to fix. The MoD has now said a British submarine was involved in the incident. It had previously said it did not comment on submarine activity. But \"new information\" had emerged to show a UK submarine was responsible for damaging the boat, named the MV Karen, the Royal Navy said. In a written statement to the House of Commons, Minister for the Armed Forces Penny Mordaunt said: \"The incident, the delay in identifying and addressing the events on that day, and their consequences are deeply regretted. \"This incident occurred because the submarine did not correctly identify the Karen as a fishing vessel with nets in the water, and thus", "Kian Delos Santos was shot by police who said he was involved in the drugs trade and had resisted arrest.

The drive has been supported by many who are fed up with drug-related crime in the Philippines. Nuns, priests and hundreds of children chanting \"justice for Kian, justice for all\" joined the cortege from a church to the cemetery where the boy was buried, Reuters news agency reports. His father, Saldy, had spoken briefly during the Mass to insist on his son's innocence and vent his anger at the police. \"Don't they have a heart?\" he asked, his voice cracking with emotion. \"I'm not sure they do.

The 72km (44 mile) route allows two-way traffic and can accommodate larger vessels. Several container ships from around the world successfully navigated it on Saturday as part of a trial run. Helicopters and naval vessels escorted the ships as part of the security operation. The Sinai Peninsula, which borders the canal, is a base for Islamic militants, who have killed hundreds of people since the military overthrew President Mohammed Morsi in 2013.

He denies 50 counts of indecent assault between the 1970s and the 1990s at St William's in Market Weighton, East Riding of Yorkshire. Two other former staff at the home also went on trial earlier. The home for boys with behavioural problems was run by the Catholic De La Salle order. It has since closed. Mr Carragher - who was head of St William's from 1976 to 1990 - and two other men are accused of abusing 19 former pupils between them.

Mr Juncker was questioned about his position on the Scottish independence referendum, due to take place in September, by Catalan MEP Josep Maria Terricabras. The official is reported to have said: \"I am in favour of democratic expressions, but I'm not so arrogant to pre-empt the debate. \"I will respect the result of Scotland's referendum.\" He added: \"One does not become a member of the EU by sending a letter.\" In a later meeting, Mr Juncker was asked by Scottish UKIP MEP, David Coburn, whether an independent Scotland would remain in the EU.

Members of the group also directed several racial slurs at minorities, said the report. Free speech advocates criticised Harvard's actions saying the punishment was \"draconian\". Information about Harvard's actions was reported by the Crimson - the main student newspaper at the prestigious college. The obscene material was posted to a chat forum on Facebook that grew out of a messaging group set up by students due to start studying at Harvard this year. The offshoot group was formed by prospective students who were interested in memes and who wanted to share more \"adult\" material than was seen in the main chat room. Anyone wanting to join the sub-group had to apply by creating and posting a \"provocative\" meme. Soon after the group was formed, Harvard administrators found out about it and launched an investigation asking students", "Community leaders from Santa Clara County filed a notice of intention on Monday to collect signatures to recall Judge Aaron Persky next year.

He was released after serving only three months in county jail for the January 2015 assault. \"Judge Aaron Persky stunned the world when he sentenced Stanford swimmer Brock Turner to six months in jail for sexually assaulting an unconscious woman behind a dumpster at a fraternity party,\" the notice to circulate a recall petition states.

Welcoming the report, ministers said they would respond within six months. The inquiry, based on the experiences of more than a thousand Welsh speakers, found that 90% of them agreed that they should have the right to use the language when dealing with NHS wherever they live in Wales. Other findings included that: Welsh speakers who gave evidence to the inquiry reported feeling awkward and struggling to explain their feelings to an English speaking doctor.

It would mean current restrictions on industrial action in the NHS, the fire service, schools and other devolved services in Wales would change.

The pair were captured by wildlife photographers in the Okavango Delta, Botswana. The cub, a spotted hyena, was abandoned by its mother and was found weak and unable to feed itself. The lioness, who had lost her own cub, took the hyena cub under her wing, providing it with food and care.\n\nThe images, which have been hailed as a testament to the resilience of nature, show the lioness tenderly licking and nurturing the hyena cub, who appears to be thriving under her care.

The survey, conducted by the Boston College Center for Work and Family, revealed a significant disparity in the use of paternity leave between men and women. Mothers, on the other hand, were more likely to take advantage of available leave, with 63% taking at least some time off after the birth or adoption of a child.\n\nThe reasons for the discrepancy are complex, but cultural norms and workplace pressures are often cited as factors. Many men worry about the stigma of taking time off work, or feel that they must be the primary breadwinner. Employers can help address these concerns by promoting a culture of family-friendly policies, providing clear guidelines on the use of leave, and offering flexible work arrangements.\n\nThe benefits of paternity leave for both men and families are well-documented. Fathers who take leave are more involved in childcare, which can lead to better outcomes for children and stronger family bonds. Employers that support paternity leave can also expect increased employee retention, improved work-life balance, and a more engaged and productive workforce.", "Title: Tragedy Strikes Irish Coastguard Rescue Helicopter 116: Four Lives Lost on March 14\n\nFour people were on board the Irish Coastguard Rescue Helicopter 116 when it went down on 14 March, plunging into the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of County Mayo.

The Trade Union Freedom Bill, introduced by Labour MP Darren Jones, aims to revoke parts of the 2016 Trade Union Act that critics argue have made it more difficult for unions to organize and take industrial action. The bill seeks to lower the turnout threshold for strikes to 25%, as well as repeal provisions that allow employers to request a vote on whether a strike should go ahead if they believe there is a risk of disruption to essential public services.\n\nSupporters of the bill argue that it will strengthen the rights of workers to take collective action and improve their bargaining power, while also reducing the disruption caused by industrial action. However, the bill is likely to face opposition from business groups, who argue that it would weaken the checks and balances on strike action and make it easier for unions to call strikes without proper consultation.\n\nThe bill is currently making its way through the House of Commons and is expected to face a vote in the coming weeks.
