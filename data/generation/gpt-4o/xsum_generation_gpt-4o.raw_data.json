Tata looked to sell its UK business, but paused the process in July. Losses at Port Talbot have been reduced by a turnaround plan and better market conditions such as rising steel prices and a drop in the pound's value. Mr Jha also said he expects the UK government to keep a promise of helping to solve the company's pension problems. However, he warned: \"We must remember that whether you drown one foot under the water or ten foot under the water, you still drown.\" A Â£485m pension deficit was given as a reason for some potential buyers being put off.

The independence referendum led to an increase in numbers of people registering to vote. Expanded electoral rolls were used to identify those who had debts. The Scottish government said local authorities would be compensated. The poll tax, or community charge, was abolished more than 20 years ago in 1993 after only four years in operation in Scotland. The unpopular poll tax, which replaced the rates system, was introduced by the Conservative Thatcher government in Scotland in 1989 before the rest of the country, sparking protests on the streets. The amount of poll tax arrears collected by local authorities across Scotland has fallen in recent years to less than Â£350,000 in 2013-14.

        "The study compared men undergoing intensive army cadet training with men whose environment remained unchanged. During training, men appeared to show a preference for heavier-looking women. Conducted by researchers at a prominent university, the study aimed to understand how physical and psychological stressors influence male perceptions of female attractiveness. The results indicated that men in high-stress, physically demanding conditions, such as army cadet training, were more likely to prefer images of women with higher body mass indices (BMIs) compared to their counterparts in stable environments.\n\nThis phenomenon is believed to be rooted in evolutionary psychology. Under stress, men may unconsciously seek partners who appear more robust and capable of surviving harsh conditions, traits often associated with higher BMIs. The findings contribute to a broader understanding of how environmental factors can shape human preferences and behaviors, offering valuable insights for fields ranging from psychology to military training programs. Further research is needed to explore the underlying mechanisms and long-term implications of these preferences.",
