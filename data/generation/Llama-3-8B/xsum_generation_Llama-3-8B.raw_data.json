The campaign also has the backing of the area's MP, Chancellor George Osborne. Cheshire West and Chester Council said a feasibility study would start soon. The Winnington Turn Bridge, which is part of the A533 between Northwich and the M56, is a Grade II listed structure and was one of the earliest swing bridges in Britain to have electric power. Vehicles can cross from both directions, but Dilys Hooper, the chairman of Barnton Parish Council, says waiting times of 40 minutes are common during rush hour in term time. \"It's just sheer mayhem, completely. It's a case of who can get across the bridge first,\" she said. Land across Northwich has been earmarked for at least 4,300 new homes.

Caroline De Wolf, of the Antwerp World Diamond Centre, estimated the haul at $50m, saying: \"What we are talking about is obviously a gigantic sum.\" Earlier reports suggested the figure was even higher - with the Belgian state broadcaster reportedly putting it at 350m euros ($468m).

The court heard how Kelly had previously been a support worker for Ms Beattie, who suffered from a number of medical conditions including seizures. The divorced mother and Kelly later became friends and often socialised together.

Gray suffered a severe spinal cord injury in police custody in April and died a week later. His death sparked weeks of protests and later riots and looting in Baltimore. \"As is often the case, during an ongoing investigation, charges can and should be revised based upon the evidence,\" Ms Mosby said. The grand jury did not return charges on the false imprisonment charges that were brought against some of the officers. Ms Mosby brought the false imprisonment charges earlier claiming that Gray's arrest was unjustified and illegal. However, the grand jury did return new reckless endangerment charges that were not part of the original charges announced three weeks ago. Ms Mosby has said that Gray's neck was broken while he was being handcuffed and placed into a police van.

Last year the government announced plans to allow parents to share their maternity and paternity leave - changes are scheduled to come in April 2015. But the ILM said its research suggested the changes would have little impact if attitudes of employers were not addressed as well. \"The introduction of shared parental leave is a crucial step towards enabling more women to progress into senior roles,\" said Charles Elvin, ILM chief executive. \"Yet our research revealed cultural barriers are impeding the uptake of both two weeks statutory paternity leave and additional paternity leave.\" He said there remained a \"cultural expectation\" within organisations that women rather than men will be the ones", "Four people were on board the Irish Coastguard Rescue Helicopter 116 when it went down on 14 March.

She said the figures were virtually the same, but just calculated differently. George Osborne was sharing a panel with Ms Lagarde and German finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble when she made the remarks. \"Generally in any election year, the teams that provide the hypotheticals on which future deficits are forecast, err on the side of caution and assume that whatever is announced is not necessarily or inevitably going to happen,\" she said. Ms Lagarde added that the UK authorities had managed to provide the right balance of spending cuts and revenue raising. \"It's clearly also delivering results, because when we look at the comparative growth rates delivered by various countries in Europe,", "Transport for London (TfL) is to consult on plans to demand a new English language test, a map-reading assessment, a fixed landline and the chance to book seven days in advance. Uber said: \"If adopted these [rules] would mean an end to the Uber people know and love.\" Black cab drivers have argued regulations need to be tightened. There has been growing pressure on city legislators, most recently when cab drivers protested outside City Hall.

It generally charges lower fares than traditional firms and drivers rely on technology for navigation. Transactions are cashless using pre-registered bank details.

The results came from a survey of 504 UK residents, who had attended at least one festival in the last year. According to ticketing website Eventbrite, which commissioned the survey, these \"superfans\" help to \"drive the music festivals market\", often recommending music and events to their friends. They account for 28% of the festival-going audience, and more than half of them (54%) say they would be willing to attend an event alone. On average, they spend \u00c2\u00a345 more per event than a casual fan, but their loyalty is not guaranteed: 46% say that festivals are becoming \"too corporate\".

Its skipper said at the time his crew were lucky to escape unharmed, and the damage would cost about \u00c2\u00a310,000 to fix. The MoD has now said a British submarine was involved in the incident. It had previously said it did not comment on submarine activity.

The drive has been supported by many who are fed up with drug-related crime in the Philippines. Nuns, priests and hundreds of children chanting \"justice for Kian, justice for all\" joined the cortege from a church to the cemetery where the boy was buried, Reuters news agency reports.

Mr Juncker was questioned about his position on the Scottish independence referendum, due to take place in September, by Catalan MEP Josep Maria Terricabras.

Other findings included that: Welsh speakers who gave evidence to the inquiry reported feeling awkward and struggling to explain their feelings to an English speaking doctor.

During training, men appeared to show a preference for heavier-looking women, according to a recent study published in the Journal of Social and Personal Relationships.Researchers from the University of California, Berkeley, found that men who underwent the rigorous training exhibited a significant shift in their attraction to women, with a preference for those who appeared more physically robust. In contrast, men whose environment remained unchanged showed no such preference.The study suggests that the physical and mental demands of army cadet training may have influenced the men's perceptions of attractiveness, leading them to value physical strength and endurance in a potential partner. The findings have implications for our understanding of how environmental factors can shape our preferences and behaviors, particularly in the context of social and cultural norms.While the study's findings are intriguing, they also raise questions about the potential long-term effects of such training on romantic relationships and societal attitudes towards women.", "In a statement, it said Foreign Affairs Secretary Perfecto Yasay would raise the issue at a major two-day Asia-Europe summit starting on Friday.
