The most interesting thing about you humans is that you're happily willingly to cohabitate with beings lesser than you. You almost see them as they are on the same level. Some of you even treat your pets better than your fellow man. That frame of thinking will only downplay your progress in the centuries to come. This mutual affection is a waste of time and space. The real treasure here are those canines you are so fond of, so loyal and trustworthy. They would make the perfect slaves. We would cage them and wash their minds. We could make them heartless, and genetically superior. Unfortunately you haven't recognized that yet. This higher ground you speak of, will keep you from becoming the level 3 civilization that you strive to be.",

Correction, he is the neighborhood watch. Him and his armada of drones, constantly watching the neighborhood. He never asks to be compensated, and when offered he would usually say something to the effect of \"Would run surveillance anyway, might as well help out.\" We had a burglary once in our neighborhood, and within the hour, the culprit was caught.

There was no possible scientific explanation for a disease that would make one dance, of all things, whenever music was heard. It just made no sense. But when we discovered that it was contagious, that I spread the disease wherever I went, the doctors started studying me seriously. Still, at the time it was still just a passing curiosity, and no hindrance to everyday life. The unease began when it turned out that the spread of the disease started to accelerate. The doctors, through careful experimentation, discovered that the disease had a delayed onset upon exposure.

        "The aliens observed the humans with a mixture of amusement and disappointment. Glocar, their leader, remarked that humans were not all that interesting compared to the other creatures on Earth. They found it puzzling that humans were so willing to live alongside animals they considered inferior, even treating them better than their own kind.

Glocar envisioned a future where these dogs could be controlled, genetically enhanced, and used as obedient servants. It was a missed opportunity, he thought, for humans to elevate themselves to a higher level of civilization.",

Amidst the chaos and destruction that surrounded him, his mind fixated on a basic human need - water. The memory of his last drink, tainted and filthy as it was, lingered in his mind like a cruel taunt.

        "I wanted with it. So I tried other tactics, like avoiding any relationships or close connections with people, thinking that if I kept myself isolated, I would never have the opportunity to destroy Earth.

He recalls the playful way his ex-wife used to tease the pearls he had personally collected off the coast of Florida during the time when Spain still held dominion over the land.

        "For as long as anyone can remember, shadows have been a constant presence in our lives. From the innocent imaginations of children to the unsettling feelings of unease in the darkness, these shadows have always been there, lurking in the background. They are not always noticeable, not always strong, but they are always present. Sometimes, under certain conditions, they can become more than just fleeting glimpses out of the corner of our eyes. In neglected spaces where light does not penetrate, where darkness thrives and grows, the shadows can gather strength and substance. They linger in the hidden corners of rooms, in the forgotten alleyways, in the dense forests where light struggles to break through. These unattended places become breeding grounds for these shadowy entities, allowing them to multiply and hunger for more. As the shadows continue to move and reach out, we can only wonder what they truly desire and what they may be capable of if given the chance to fully manifest.",

The once thriving arms industry now faced a crisis of dwindling profits and a lack of global conflicts to fuel their business. The CEOs and executives, the titans of war profiteering, sat in somber contemplation as they grappled with the reality of their declining sales. The idea that America's adversaries were too impoverished to sustain the demand for weapons lingered in the minds of those present.

As he rambled on about stocks and bonds, I could barely contain my amusement. It was clear that this man had no understanding of the true value of my hoard or the power that it held.

The memories of what you did linger like a bitter taste in my mouth, a reminder of the shattered trust and broken promises. Like a skilled artisan, you expertly wielded your hammer of deceit, smashing my faith in humanity into a million glittering shards. I once believed we were kindred spirits, bound by an unbreakable bond of friendship. But now I see the truth - friends do not inflict the kind of pain and betrayal that you unleashed upon me. I delved into the depths of self-help guides, searching for a way to protect myself from the likes of you. They whispered cautionary tales of never letting my guard down, of watching my back in dark alleys and dimly lit bars. They preached the gospel of self-defense classes and aiming for the jugular in times of peril. But they failed me, for they never warned me about you. They never taught me how to recognize the wolf in sheep's clothing, hiding in plain sight amongst my trusted circle. The guides never prepared me for the moment when you would cross the line, violating my most sacred right - my bodily autonomy.

Little did I know that it would quickly spiral into a woman's worst nightmare. Phil, with his charming smile and kind demeanor, had invited me over for what was supposed to be our third date. As I settled onto his pristine white sofa, the soft glow of the TV casting a warm light around the room, Phil's phone rang. It was his son, Mark, calling from practice. His mom had failed to show up to pick him up, leaving Phil in a bind. Apologizing profusely, he asked if I wouldn't mind waiting just twenty minutes while he went to fetch his son.

Panic set in as I realized I was unprepared, my period arriving earlier than expected.

Should I trust this stranger in my bathroom? As I stood there, dumbfounded, I couldn't help but wonder how Tom had managed to sneak into my house undetected. But there was something about his casual demeanor that put me at ease. Maybe it was the fact that he offered me a beer, or maybe it was the way he seemed completely unfazed by my shock. Whatever it was, I found myself nodding and accepting the drink. And as we sat on the bathroom floor, sipping our beers, I couldn't help but laugh at the absurdity of the situation. Who would have thought that my irrational fear of shower curtains would lead me to make a new friend in the most unexpected of places?",
