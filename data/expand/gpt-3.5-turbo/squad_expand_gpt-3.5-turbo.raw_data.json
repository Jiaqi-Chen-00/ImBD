        "Like the reptiles, birds are primarily uricotelic, that is, their kidneys extract nitrogenous waste from their bloodstream and excrete it as uric acid instead of urea or ammonia through the ureters into the intestine. Birds do not have a urinary bladder or external urethral opening and (with exception of the ostrich) uric acid is excreted along with feces as a semisolid waste. However, birds such as hummingbirds can be facultatively ammonotelic, excreting most of the nitrogenous wastes as ammonia. They also excrete creatine, rather than creatinine like mammals. This material, as well as the output of the intestines, emerges from the bird's cloaca. The cloaca is a multi-purpose opening: waste is expelled through it, most birds mate by joining cloaca, and females lay eggs from it. In addition, many species of birds regurgitate pellets. Males within Palaeognathae (with the exception of the kiwis), the Anseriformes (with the",
        "Mammalian hair, also known as pelage, can vary in color between populations, organisms within a population, and even on the individual organism. Light-dark color variation is common in the mammalian taxa. Sometimes, this color variation is determined by age variation, however, in other cases, it is determined by other factors. Selective pressures, such as ecological interactions with other populations or environmental conditions, often lead to the variation in mammalian coloration. These selective pressures favor certain colors in order to increase survival. Camouflage is thought to be a major selection pressure shaping coloration in mammals, although there is also evidence that sexual selection, communication, and physiological processes may influence the evolution of coloration as well. Camouflage is the most predominant mechanism for color variation, as",
        "Education in Israel is highly valued in the national culture with its historical values dating back to Ancient Israel and was viewed as one fundamental blocks of ancient Israelite life. Israeli culture views higher education as the key to higher mobility and socioeconomic status in Israeli society. The emphasis of education within Israeli society goes to the gulf within the Jewish diaspora from the Renaissance and Enlightenment Movement all the way to the roots of Zionism in the 1880s. Jewish communities in the Levant were the first to introduce compulsory education for which the organized community, not less than the parents, was responsible for the education of the next generation of Jews. With contemporary Jewish culture's strong emphasis, promotion of scholarship and learning and the strong propensity to promote cultivation of intellectual pursuits as well as the nations high university educational attainment rate exemplifies how highly Israeli society values higher education. The Israeli education system has been praised",

        "Following the fall of Wu and the turmoil of the Wu Hu uprising against the Jin dynasty (265–420), most of elite Chinese families had collaborated with the non-Chinese rulers and military conquerors in the north. Some may have lost social privilege, and took refugee in areas south to Yangtze River. Some of the Chinese refugees from north China might have resided in areas near Hangzhou. For example, the clan of Zhuge Liang (181–234), a chancellor of the state of Shu Han from Central Plain in north China during the Three Kingdoms period, gathered together at the suburb of Hangzhou, forming an exclusive, closed village Zhuge Village (Zhege Cun), consisting of villagers all with family name \"Zhuge\". The village has intentionally isolated itself from the surrounding communities for centuries to this day, and only recently came to be known in public. It suggests that a small number of powerful, elite Chinese refugees from the Central Plain might have taken refugee in",
        "The '98 season would begin on a somber note with the death of legendary broadcaster Harry Caray. After the retirement of Sandberg and the trade of Dunston, the Cubs had holes to fill and the signing of Henry Rodríguez, known affectionately as \"H-Rod\" to bat cleanup provided protection for Sammy Sosa in the lineup, as Rodriguez slugged 31 round-trippers in his first season in Chicago. Kevin Tapani led the club with a career high 19 wins, Rod Beck anchored a strong bullpen and Mark Grace turned in one of his best seasons. The Cubs were swamped by media attention in 1998, and the team's two biggest headliners were Sosa and rookie flamethrower Kerry Wood. Wood's signature performance was one-hitting the Houston Astros, a game in which he tied the major league record of 20 strikeouts in nine innings. His torrid strikeout numbers earned Wood the nickname \"Kid K,\" and ultimately earned him the 1998 NL Rookie of the Year award. Sosa caught fire in June, hitting a major league record 20 home runs in the",
        "In contemporary society, adolescents also face some risks as their sexuality begins to transform. While some of these, such as emotional distress (fear of abuse or exploitation) and sexually transmitted infections/diseases (STIs/STDs), including HIV/AIDS, are not necessarily inherent to adolescence, others such as teenage pregnancy (through non-use or failure of contraceptives) are seen as social problems in most western societies. One in four sexually active teenagers will contract an STI. Adolescents in the United States often chose \"anything but intercourse\" for sexual activity because they mistakenly believe it reduces the risk of STIs. Across the country, clinicians report rising diagnoses of herpes and human papillomavirus (HPV), which can cause genital warts, and is now thought to affect 15 percent",
        "Throughout the history of the South Slavs, the vernacular, literary, and written languages (e.g. Chakavian, Kajkavian, Shtokavian) of the various regions and ethnicities developed and diverged independently. Prior to the 19th century, they were collectively called \"Illyric\", \"Slavic\", \"Slavonian\", \"Bosnian\", \"Dalmatian\", \"Serbian\" or \"Croatian\". As such, the term Serbo-Croatian was first used by Jacob Grimm in 1824, popularized by the Vienna philologist Jernej Kopitar in the following decades, and accepted by Croatian Zagreb grammarians in 1854 and 1859. At that time, Serb and Croat lands were still part of the Ottoman and Austrian Empires. Officially, the language was called variously Serbo-Croat, Croato-Serbian, Serbian and Croatian, Croatian and Serbian, Serbian or Croatian, Croatian or Serbian. Unofficially, Serbs and Croats typically called the language \"Serbian\" or \"Croatian\", respectively, without implying a distinction between the two, and again in independent Bosnia and Herzegovina, \"Bosnian\", \"Croatian\", and \"Serbian\" were considered to be three names of a single",
        "Identity development is a stage in the adolescent life cycle. For most, the search for identity begins in the adolescent years. During these years, adolescents are more open to 'trying on' different behaviours and appearances to discover who they are. In other words, in an attempt to find their identity and discover who they are adolescents are liking to cycle through a number of identities to find one that suits them best. But, developing and maintaining identity (in adolescent years) is a difficult task due to multiple factors such as family life, environment, and social status. Empirical studies suggest that this process might be more accurately described as identity development, rather than formation, but confirms a normative process of change in both content and structure of",
        "The vast Seleucid Empire was, like Egypt, mostly dominated by a Greco-Macedonian political elite. The Greek population of the cities who formed the dominant elite were reinforced by emigration from Greece. These cities included newly founded colonies such as Antioch, the other cities of the Syrian tetrapolis, Seleucia (north of Babylon) and Dura-Europos on the Euphrates. These cities retained traditional Greek city state institutions such as assemblies, councils and elected magistrates, but this was a facade for they were always controlled by the royal Seleucid officials. Apart from these cities, there were also a large number of Seleucid garrisons (choria), military colonies (katoikiai) and Greek villages (komai) which the Seleucids planted throughout the empire to cement their rule. This 'Greco-Macedonian' population (which also",
        "The implications are multiple as various research traditions are now[when?] heavily utilizing the lens of identity to examine phenomena.[citation needed] One implication of identity and of identity construction can be seen in occupational settings. This becomes increasing challenging in stigmatized jobs or \"dirty work\" (Hughes, 1951). Tracy and Trethewey (2005) state that \"individuals gravitate toward and turn away from particular jobs depending in part, on the extent to which they validate a \"preferred organizational self\" (Tracy & Tretheway 2005, p. 169). Some jobs carry different stigmas or acclaims. In her analysis Tracy uses the example of correctional officers trying to shake the stigma of \"glorified maids\" (Tracy & Tretheway 2005). \"The process by which people arrive at justifications of and values for various occupational choices.\" Among these are workplace satisfaction and overall quality of life (Tracy & Scott 2006, p. 33).

        "Emotions can motivate social interactions and relationships and therefore are directly related with basic physiology, particularly with the stress systems. This is important because emotions are related to the anti-stress complex, with an oxytocin-attachment system, which plays a major role in bonding. Emotional phenotype temperaments affect social connectedness and fitness in complex social systems (Kurt Kortschal 2013). These characteristics are shared with other species and taxa and are due to the effects of genes and their continuous transmission. Information that is encoded in the DNA sequences provides the blueprint for assembling proteins that make up our cells. Zygotes require genetic information from their parental germ cells, and at every speciation event, heritable traits that have enabled its ancestor to",
        "Stanley Schachter formulated his theory on the earlier work of a Spanish physician, Gregorio Marañón, who injected patients with epinephrine and subsequently asked them how they felt. Interestingly, Marañón found that most of these patients felt something but in the absence of an actual emotion-evoking stimulus, the patients were unable to interpret their physiological arousal as an experienced emotion. Schachter did agree that physiological reactions played a big role in emotions. He suggested that physiological reactions contributed to emotional experience by facilitating a focused cognitive appraisal of a given physiologically arousing event and that this appraisal was what defined the subjective emotional experience. Emotions were thus a result of two-stage process: general physiological arousal, and experience of emotion. For example, the physiological arousal, heart pounding, in a response to an evoking stimulus, the sight of a bear in the kitchen.",
        "The political turmoil continued. John began to explore an alliance with the French king Philip II, freshly returned from the crusade. John hoped to acquire Normandy, Anjou and the other lands in France held by Richard in exchange for allying himself with Philip. John was persuaded not to pursue an alliance by his mother. Longchamp, who had left England after Walter's intervention, now returned, and argued that he had been wrongly removed as justiciar. John intervened, suppressing Longchamp's claims in return for promises of support from the royal administration, including a reaffirmation of his position as heir to the throne. When Richard still did not return from the crusade, John began to assert that his brother was dead or otherwise permanently lost. Richard had in fact been captured en route to England by the Duke of Austria and was handed over to Emperor Henry VI, who held him for ransom. John seized the opportunity and went",
        "Early Modern universities initially continued the curriculum and research of the Middle Ages: natural philosophy, logic, medicine, theology, mathematics, astronomy (and astrology), law, grammar and rhetoric. Aristotle was prevalent throughout the curriculum, while medicine also depended on Galen and Arabic scholarship. The importance of humanism for changing this state-of-affairs cannot be underestimated. Once humanist professors joined the university faculty, they began to transform the study of grammar and rhetoric through the studia humanitatis. Humanist professors focused on the ability of students to write and speak with distinction, to translate and interpret classical texts, and to live honorable lives. Other scholars within the university were affected by the humanist approaches to learning and their linguistic expertise in relation to ancient texts, as well as the ideology that advocated the ultimate importance of those texts. Professors of medicine such as Niccolò Leoniceno, Thomas Linacre and William Cop were often trained in and taught from a humanist perspective as",
        "Democratic Party candidates were consistently elected to local office, increasing the city's ties to the South and its dominant party. In 1861, Mayor Fernando Wood called on the aldermen to declare independence from Albany and the United States after the South seceded, but his proposal was not acted on. Anger at new military conscription laws during the American Civil War (1861–1865), which spared wealthier men who could afford to pay a $300 (equivalent to $5,766 in 2016) commutation fee to hire a substitute, led to the Draft Riots of 1863, whose most visible participants were ethnic Irish working class. The situation deteriorated into attacks on New York's elite, followed by attacks on black New Yorkers and their property after fierce competition for a decade between Irish immigrants and blacks for work. Rioters burned the Colored Orphan Asylum to the ground, but more than 200 children escaped harm due to efforts of the",
        "But in the mid-18th century, during the French Enlightenment, a more ideological use of the term had come into use. In 1765, the author of an anonymous article in a French Enlightenment periodical spoke of \"The general love of humanity ... a virtue hitherto quite nameless among us, and which we will venture to call 'humanism', for the time has come to create a word for such a beautiful and necessary thing\". The latter part of the 18th and the early 19th centuries saw the creation of numerous grass-roots \"philanthropic\" and benevolent societies dedicated to human betterment and the spreading of knowledge (some Christian, some not). After the French Revolution, the idea that human virtue could be created by human reason alone independently from traditional religious institutions, attributed by opponents of the Revolution to Enlightenment philosophes such as Rousseau, was violently",
        "The result was a sequence of innovative but unpopular financial measures.[nb 10] John levied scutage payments eleven times in his seventeen years as king, as compared to eleven times in total during the reign of the preceding three monarchs. In many cases these were levied in the absence of any actual military campaign, which ran counter to the original idea that scutage was an alternative to actual military service. John maximised his right to demand relief payments when estates and castles were inherited, sometimes charging enormous sums, beyond barons' abilities to pay. Building on the successful sale of sheriff appointments in 1194, John initiated a new round of appointments, with the new incumbents making back their investment through increased fines and penalties, particularly in the forests. Another innovation of Richard's, increased charges levied on widows who wished to remain single, was expanded under John. John continued to sell charters for new towns, including",
        "A number of novel ideas about religion developed with the Enlightenment, including Deism and talk of atheism. Deism, according to Thomas Paine, is the simple belief in God the Creator, with no reference to the Bible or any other miraculous source. Instead, the Deist relies solely on personal reason to guide his creed, which was eminently agreeable to many thinkers of the time. Atheism was much discussed, but there were few proponents. Wilson and Reill note that, \"In fact, very few enlightened intellectuals, even when they were vocal critics of Christianity, were true atheists. Rather, they were critics of orthodox belief, wedded rather to skepticism, deism, vitalism, or perhaps pantheism.\" Some followed Pierre Bayle and argued that atheists could indeed be moral men. Many others like Voltaire held that without belief in a God who punishes evil, the moral order of society was undermined. That is, since atheists gave themselves to no Supreme Authority and no law, and had no fear of",
        "Sleep does not affect acquisition or recall while one is awake. Therefore, sleep has the greatest effect on memory consolidation. During sleep, the neural connections in the brain are strengthened. This enhances the brain’s abilities to stabilize and retain memories. There have been several studies which show that sleep improves the retention of memory, as memories are enhanced through active consolidation. System consolidation takes place during slow-wave sleep (SWS). This process implicates that memories are reactivated during sleep, but that the process doesn’t enhance every memory. It also implicates that qualitative changes are made to the memories when they are transferred to long-term store during sleep. When you are sleeping, the hippocampus replays the events of the day for the neocortex. The neocortex then reviews and processes memories, which moves them into long-term memory. When you do not get enough sleep it makes it more difficult to learn as these neural connections are not as strong, resulting in a lower",
        "Although people often think that memory operates like recording equipment, it is not the case. The molecular mechanisms underlying the induction and maintenance of memory are very dynamic and comprise distinct phases covering a time window from seconds to even a lifetime. In fact, research has revealed that our memories are constructed. People can construct their memories when they encode them and/or when they recall them. To illustrate, consider a classic study conducted by Elizabeth Loftus and John Palmer (1974) in which people were instructed to watch a film of a traffic accident and then asked about what they saw. The researchers found that the people who were asked, \"How fast were the cars going when they smashed into each other?\" gave higher estimates than those who were asked, \"How fast were the cars going when they hit each other?\" Furthermore, when asked a week later whether they have seen broken glass in the film, those who had been asked the question with smashed were twice more likely to report that they have seen broken",

Instead, this area was populated by peoples collectively known as the Hundred Yue, including the Dongyue and the Ouyue. The kingdom of Yue began to appear in the chronicles and records written during the Spring and Autumn Period. According to the chronicles, the kingdom of Yue was located in northern Zhejiang. Shiji claims that its leaders were descended from the Shang founder Yu the Great. Evidence suggests that Baiyue and the kingdom of Yue possessed their own culture and history that are different from those kingdoms in north and central China, whose cultures and histories were carefully recorded in chronicles and histories during the Spring and Autumn Period and into the Qin dynasty.

        "Protestantism also spread from the German lands into France, where the Protestants were nicknamed Huguenots. Calvin continued to take an interest in the French religious affairs from his base in Geneva. He regularly trained pastors to lead congregations there. Despite heavy persecution, the Reformed tradition made steady progress across large sections of the nation, appealing to people alienated by the obduracy and the complacency of the Catholic establishment. French Protestantism came to acquire a distinctly political character, made all the more obvious by the conversions of nobles during the 1550s. This established the preconditions for a series of conflicts, known as the French Wars of Religion. The civil wars gained impetus with the sudden death of Henry II of France in 1559. Atrocity and outrage became the defining characteristics of the time, illustrated at their most intense in the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre of August 1572, when the Roman Catholic party annihilated between 30,000 and 100,000 Huguenots across France. The wars",

Every NFL team plays exactly four pre-season exhibition games a year, two at home and two away, with the exception of two teams each year who play a fifth game, the Pro Football Hall of Fame Game. These exhibition games, most of which are held in the month of August, are played for the purpose of helping coaches narrow down the roster from the offseason limit of 90 players to the regular-season limit of 53 players. While the scheduling formula is not as rigid for preseason games as they are for the regular season, there are numerous restrictions and traditions that limit the choices of preseason opponents; teams are also restricted on what days and times they can play these games.

Focusing on irrigation projects, 1983 saw construction start on \"Gaddafi's Pet Project\", the Great Man-Made River; although designed to be finished by the end of the decade, it remained incomplete at the start of the 21st century. Military spending increased, while other administrative budgets were cut back. Libya had long supported the FROLINAT militia in neighbouring Chad, and in December 1980, re-invaded Chad at the request of the Frolinat-controlled GUNT government to aid in the civil war; in January 1981, Gaddafi suggested a political merger. The Organisation of African Unity (OAU) rejected this, and called for a Libyan withdrawal, which came about in November 1981.

More than 8,000 riot police were deployed to guard the 24-kilometre route, which began at Olympic Park, which was built when Seoul hosted the 1988 Summer Games. On the day of the torch relay in Seoul, Chinese students clashed with protesters, throwing rocks, bottles, and punches. A North Korean defector whose brother defected to China but was captured and executed by the DPRK, attempted to set himself on fire in protest of China's treatment of North Korean refugees.

Jefferson refused to issue Proclamations of Thanksgiving sent to him by Congress during his presidency, though he did issue a Thanksgiving and Prayer proclamation as Governor of Virginia. Madison issued four religious proclamations while President, but vetoed two bills on the grounds they violated the first amendment. On the other hand, both Jefferson and Madison attended religious services at the Capitol. Years before the ratification of the Constitution, Madison contended \"Because if Religion be exempt from the authority of the Society at large, still less can it be subject to that of the Legislative Body.\" After retiring from the presidency, Madison wrote of \"total separation of the church from the state.\" \" \"Strongly guarded as is the separation between Religion & Govt in the Constitution of the United States,\" Madison wrote, and he declared, \"practical distinction between Religion and Civil Government",
        "The works of Virgil almost from the moment of their publication revolutionized Latin poetry. The Eclogues, Georgics, and above all the Aeneid became standard texts in school curricula with which all educated Romans were familiar. Poets following Virgil often refer intertextually to his works to generate meaning in their own poetry. The Augustan poet Ovid parodies the opening lines of the Aeneid in Amores 1.1.1–2, and his summary of the Aeneas story in Book 14 of the Metamorphoses, the so-called \"mini-Aeneid\", has been viewed as a particularly important example of post-Virgilian response to the epic genre. Lucan's epic, the Bellum Civile has been considered an anti-Virgilian epic, disposing with the divine mechanism, treating historical events, and diverging drastically from Virgilian epic practice. The Flavian poet Statius in his 12-book epic Thebaid engages closely with the poetry of Virgil; in his epilogue he advises his poem not to \"rival the divine Aeneid, but follow afar and ever venerate its footsteps.\" In Silius Italicus, Virgil",
        "Terry Eastland, the author who wrote From Ending Affirmative Action: The Case for Colorblind Justice states, \"Most arguments for affirmative action fall into two categories: remedying past discrimination and promoting diversity\". Eastland believes that the founders of affirmative action did not anticipate how the benefits of affirmative action would go to those who did not need it, mostly middle class minorities. Additionally, she argues that affirmative action carries with it a stigma that can create feelings of self-doubt and entitlement in minorities. Eastland believes that affirmative action is a great risk that only sometimes pays off, and that without it we would be able to compete more freely with one another. Libertarian economist Thomas Sowell identified what he says are negative results of affirmative action in his book, Affirmative Action Around the World: An Empirical Study. Sowell writes that affirmative action policies encourage non-preferred groups to designate themselves as members of preferred groups [i.e., primary beneficiaries of affirmative action] to",
        "By far the largest military action in which the United States engaged during this era was the War of 1812. With Britain locked in a major war with Napoleon's France, its policy was to block American shipments to France. The United States sought to remain neutral while pursuing overseas trade. Britain cut the trade and impressed seamen on American ships into the Royal Navy, despite intense protests. Britain supported an Indian insurrection in the American Midwest, with the goal of creating an Indian state there that would block American expansion. The United States finally declared war on the United Kingdom in 1812, the first time the U.S. had officially declared war. Not hopeful of defeating the Royal Navy, the U.S. attacked the British Empire by invading British Canada, hoping to use captured territory as a bargaining chip. The invasion of Canada was a debacle, though concurrent wars with Native Americans on the western front (Tecumseh's War and the Creek War) were more successful. After defeating Napoleon in 1814, Britain sent large veteran armies to invade",

However, Qing policy changed with the establishment of Xinjiang province in 1884. During The Great Game era, taking advantage of the Dungan revolt in northwest China, Yaqub Beg invaded Xinjiang from Central Asia with support from the British Empire, and made himself the ruler of the kingdom of Kashgaria. The Qing court sent forces to defeat Yaqub Beg and Xinjiang was reconquered, and then the political system of China proper was formally applied onto Xinjiang. The Kumul Khanate, which was incorporated into the Qing empire as a vassal after helping Qing defeat the Zunghars in 1757, maintained its status after Xinjiang turned into a province through the end of the dynasty in the Xinhai Revolution up until 1930.

        "BYU has 21 NCAA varsity teams. Nineteen of these teams played mainly in the Mountain West Conference from its inception in 1999 until the school left that conference in 2011. Prior to that time BYU teams competed in the Western Athletic Conference. All teams are named the \"Cougars\", and Cosmo the Cougar has been the school's mascot since 1953. The school's fight song is the Cougar Fight Song. Because many of its players serve on full-time missions for two years (men when they're 18, women when 19), BYU athletes are often older on average than other schools' players. The NCAA allows students to serve missions for two years without subtracting that time from their eligibility period. This has caused minor controversy, but is largely recognized as not lending the school any significant advantage, since players receive no athletic and little physical training during their missions. BYU has also received attention from sports networks for refusal to play games on",
        "John treated the interdict as \"the equivalent of a papal declaration of war\". He responded by attempting to punish Innocent personally and to drive a wedge between those English clergy that might support him and those allying themselves firmly with the authorities in Rome. John seized the lands of those clergy unwilling to conduct services, as well as those estates linked to Innocent himself; he arrested the illicit concubines that many clerics kept during the period, only releasing them after the payment of fines; he seized the lands of members of the church who had fled England, and he promised protection for those clergy willing to remain loyal to him. In many cases, individual institutions were able to negotiate terms for managing their own properties and keeping the produce of their estates. By 1209 the situation showed no signs of resolution, and Innocent threatened to excommunicate John if he did not acquiesce to Langton's appointment. When this threat failed, Innocent",

After the Doolittle Raid, the Japanese army conducted a massive sweep through Zhejiang and Jiangxi of China, now known as the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Campaign, with the goal of searching out the surviving American airmen, applying retribution on the Chinese who aided them and destroying air bases.

        "Dorgon's controversial July 1645 edict (the \"haircutting order\") forced adult Han Chinese men to shave the front of their heads and comb the remaining hair into the queue hairstyle which was worn by Manchu men, on pain of death. The popular description of the order was: \"To keep the hair, you lose the head; To keep your head, you cut the hair.\" To the Manchus, this policy was a test of loyalty and an aid in distinguishing friend from foe. For the Han Chinese, however, it was a humiliating reminder of Qing authority that challenged traditional Confucian values. The Classic of Filial Piety (Xiaojing) held that \"a person's body and hair, being gifts from one's parents, are not to be damaged.\" Under the Ming dynasty, adult men did not cut their hair but instead wore",
        "Boundaries can be inclusive or exclusive depending on how they are perceived by other people. An exclusive boundary arises, for example, when a person adopts a marker that imposes restrictions on the behaviour of others. An inclusive boundary is created, by contrast, by the use of a marker with which other people are ready and able to associate. At the same time, however, an inclusive boundary will also impose restrictions on the people it has included by limiting their inclusion within other boundaries. An example of this is the use of a particular language by a newcomer in a room full of people speaking various languages. Some people may understand the language used by this person while others may not. Those who do not understand it might take the newcomer's use of this particular language merely as a neutral sign of identity. But they might also perceive it as imposing an exclusive boundary that is meant to mark them off from her. On the other",

In the United States, Columbia Records introduced flexible, fiber-cored \"Marconi Velvet Tone Record\" pressings in 1907, but the advantages and longevity of their relatively noiseless surfaces depended on the scrupulous use of special gold-plated Marconi Needles and the product was not a success.

The date of the assignment was retroactively established on Armistice Day. It is doubtful whether a referendum in Strasbourg would have ended in France's favour since the political parties striving for an autonomous Alsace or a connection to France accounted only for a small proportion of votes in the last Reichstag as well as in the local elections. The Alsatian autonomists who were pro French had won many votes in the more rural parts of the region and other towns since the annexation of the region by Germany in 1871. The movement started with the first election for the Reichstag; those elected were called \"les députés protestataires\", and until the fall of Bismarck in 1890, they were the only deputies elected by the Alsatians to the German",
        "As Western Europe witnessed the formation of new kingdoms, the Eastern Roman Empire remained intact and experienced an economic revival that lasted into the early 7th century. There were fewer invasions of the eastern section of the empire; most occurred in the Balkans. Peace with Persia, the traditional enemy of Rome, lasted throughout most of the 5th century. The Eastern Empire was marked by closer relations between the political state and Christian Church, with doctrinal matters assuming an importance in eastern politics that they did not have in Western Europe. Legal developments included the codification of Roman law; the first effort—the Theodosian Code—was completed in 438. Under Emperor Justinian (r. 527–565), another compilation took place—the Corpus Juris Civilis. Justinian also oversaw the construction of the Hagia Sophia in Constantinople and the reconquest of North Africa from the Vandals and Italy from the Ostrogoths, under Belisarius (d. 565). The conquest of Italy was not complete, as a deadly outbreak of plague in 542 led to the rest of Justinian's reign concentrating on defensive measures",
        "When Nintendo released the NES in the US, the design styling was deliberately different from that of other game consoles. Nintendo wanted to distinguish its product from those of competitors and to avoid the generally poor reputation that game consoles had acquired following the video game crash of 1983. One result of this philosophy was to disguise the cartridge slot design as a front-loading zero insertion force (ZIF) cartridge socket, designed to resemble the front-loading mechanism of a VCR. The newly designed connector worked quite well when both the connector and the cartridges were clean and the pins on the connector were new. Unfortunately, the ZIF connector was not truly zero insertion force. When a user inserted the cartridge into the NES, the force of pressing the cartridge down and into place bent the contact pins slightly, as well as pressing the cartridge’s ROM board back into the cartridge itself. Frequent insertion and removal of cartridges caused the pins to wear out from repeated usage over the years and the ZIF",
        "Protestants also took the initiative in advocating for religious freedom. Freedom of conscience had high priority on the theological, philosophical, and political agendas since Luther refused to recant his beliefs before the Diet of the Holy Roman Empire at Worms (1521). In his view, faith was a free work of the Holy Spirit and could, therefore, not be forced on a person. The persecuted Anabaptists and Huguenots demanded freedom of conscience, and they practised separation of church and state. In the early seventeenth century, Baptists like John Smyth and Thomas Helwys published tracts in defense of religious freedom. Their thinking influenced John Milton and John Locke's stance on tolerance. Under the leadership of Baptist Roger Williams, Congregationalist Thomas Hooker, and Quaker William Penn, respectively, Rhode Island, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania combined democratic constitutions with freedom of religion. These colonies became safe havens for persecuted religious minorities, including Jews.

        "Birds have a very efficient system for diffusing oxygen into the blood; birds have a ten times greater surface area to gas exchange volume than mammals. As a result, birds have more blood in their capillaries per unit of volume of lung than a mammal. The arteries are composed of thick elastic muscles to withstand the pressure of the ventricular constriction, and become more rigid as they move away from the heart. Blood moves through the arteries, which undergo vasoconstriction, and into arterioles which act as a transportation system to distribute primarily oxygen as well as nutrients to all tissues of the body. As the arterioles move away from the heart and into individual organs and tissues they are further divided to increase surface area and slow blood flow. Travelling through the arterioles blood moves into the capillaries where gas exchange can occur. Capillaries are organized into capillary beds in tissues, it",

Former player Austin Carr holds the record for most points scored in a single game of the tournament with 61. Although the team has never won the NCAA Tournament, they were named by the Helms Athletic Foundation as national champions twice. The team has orchestrated a number of upsets of number one ranked teams, the most notable of which was ending UCLA's record 88-game winning streak in 1974. The team has beaten an additional eight number-one teams, and those nine wins rank second, to UCLA's 10, all-time in wins against the top team.

An 1838 edition of Mechanics Magazine cites an early use of asphalt in France. A pamphlet dated 1621, by \"a certain Monsieur d'Eyrinys, states that he had discovered the existence (of asphaltum) in large quantities in the vicinity of Neufchatel\", and that he proposed to use it in a variety of ways – \"principally in the construction of air-proof granaries, and in protecting, by means of the arches, the water-courses in the city of Paris from the intrusion of dirt and filth\", which at",

        "Some street trams (streetcars) used conduit third-rail current collection. The third rail was below street level. The tram picked up the current through a plough (U.S. \"plow\") accessed through a narrow slot in the road. In the United States, much (though not all) of the former streetcar system in Washington, D.C. (discontinued in 1962) was operated in this manner to avoid the unsightly wires and poles associated with electric traction. The same was true with Manhattan's former streetcar system. The evidence of this mode of running can still be seen on the track down the slope on the northern access to the abandoned Kingsway Tramway Subway in central London, United Kingdom, where the slot between the running rails is clearly visible, and on P and Q Streets west of Wisconsin Avenue in the Georgetown neighborhood of",

The New York City borough of Queens is home to the state's largest Asian American population and the largest Andean (Colombian, Ecuadorian, Peruvian, and Bolivian) populations in the United States, and is also the most ethnically diverse urban area in the world. The Chinese population constitutes the fastest-growing nationality in New York State; multiple satellites of the original Manhattan Chinatown (紐約華埠), in Brooklyn (布鲁克林華埠), and around Flushing, Queens (法拉盛華埠), are thriving as traditionally urban enclaves, while also expanding rapidly eastward into suburban Nassau County (拿騷縣) on Long Island (長島), as the New York metropolitan region and New York State have become the top destinations for new Chinese immigrants, respectively, and large-scale Chinese immigration continues into New York City and surrounding areas.

        "Jeffrey Long and Rick Kittles give a long critique of the application of FST to human populations in their 2003 paper \"Human Genetic Diversity and the Nonexistence of Biological Races\". They find that the figure of 85% is misleading because it implies that all human populations contain on average 85% of all genetic diversity. They claim that this does not correctly reflect human population history, because it treats all human groups as independent. A more realistic portrayal of the way human groups are related is to understand that some human groups are parental to other groups and that these groups represent paraphyletic groups to their descent groups. For example, under the recent African origin theory the human population in Africa is paraphyletic to all other human groups because it represents the ancestral group from which all non-African populations derive, but more than that, non-African groups only derive from a small non-representative sample of",
        "Libya's economy witnessed increasing privatization; although rejecting the socialist policies of nationalized industry advocated in The Green Book, government figures asserted that they were forging \"people's socialism\" rather than capitalism. Gaddafi welcomed these reforms, calling for wide-scale privatization in a March 2003 speech. In 2003, the oil industry was largely sold to private corporations, and by 2004, there was $40 billion of direct foreign investment in Libya, a sixfold rise over 2003. Sectors of Libya's population reacted against these reforms with public demonstrations, and in March 2006, revolutionary hard-liners took control of the GPC cabinet; although scaling back the pace of the changes, they did not halt them. In 2010, plans were announced that would have seen half the Libyan economy privatized over the following decade. While there was no accompanying political liberalization, with Gaddafi retaining predominant control, in March 2010, the government devolved further powers to the municipal councils.

        "The initial military maneuvers began in September 1806. In a notable letter to Marshal Soult detailing the plan for the campaign, Napoleon described the essential features of Napoleonic warfare and introduced the phrase le bataillon-carré ('square battalion'). In the bataillon-carré system, the various corps of the Grande Armée would march uniformly together in close supporting distance. If any single corps was attacked, the others could quickly spring into action and arrive to help. Napoleon invaded Prussia with 180,000 troops, rapidly marching on the right bank of the River Saale. As in previous campaigns, his fundamental objective was to destroy one opponent before reinforcements from another could tip the balance of the war. Upon learning the whereabouts of the Prussian army, the French swung westwards and crossed the Saale with overwhelming force. At the twin battles of Jena and Auerstedt, fought on 14 October, the French convincingly defeated",
        "Regarding the timing of German rapprochement, many historians agree that the dismissal of Maxim Litvinov, whose Jewish ethnicity was viewed unfavorably by Nazi Germany, removed an obstacle to negotiations with Germany. Stalin immediately directed Molotov to \"purge the ministry of Jews.\" Given Litvinov's prior attempts to create an anti-fascist coalition, association with the doctrine of collective security with France and Britain, and pro-Western orientation by the standards of the Kremlin, his dismissal indicated the existence of a Soviet option of rapprochement with Germany.[f] Likewise, Molotov's appointment served as a signal to Germany that the USSR was open to offers. The dismissal also signaled to France and Britain the existence of a potential negotiation option with Germany. One British official wrote that Litvinov's disappearance also meant the loss of an admirable technician or shock-absorber, while Molotov's \"modus operandi\" was \"more truly Bolshevik than diplomatic or cosmopolitan.\" Carr argued that the Soviet Union's replacement of Foreign",
        "Critics labelled Gaddafi \"despotic, cruel, arrogant, vain and stupid\", with western governments and press presenting him as the \"vicious dictator of an oppressed people\". During the Reagan administration, the United States regarded him as \"Public Enemy No. 1\" and Reagan famously dubbed him the \"mad dog of the Middle East\". According to critics, the Libyan people lived in a climate of fear under Gaddafi's administration, due to his government's pervasive surveillance of civilians. Gaddafi's Libya was typically described by western commentators as \"a police state\". Opponents were critical of Libya's human rights abuses; according to Human Rights Watch (HRW) and others, hundreds of arrested political opponents often failed to receive a fair trial, and were sometimes subjected to torture or extrajudicial execution, most notably in the Abu Salim prison, including an alleged massacre on 29 June 1996 in which HRW estimated that",
        "A true predator can commonly be known as one that kills and eats another living thing. Whereas other types of predator all harm their prey in some way, this form kills them. Predators may hunt actively for prey in pursuit predation, or sit and wait for prey to approach within striking distance, as in ambush predators. Some predators kill large prey and dismember or chew it prior to eating it, such as a jaguar or a human; others may eat their (usually much smaller) prey whole, as does a bottlenose dolphin swallowing a fish, or a snake, duck or stork swallowing a frog. Some animals that kill both large and small prey for their size (domestic cats and dogs are prime examples) may do either depending upon the circumstances; either would devour a large insect whole but dismember a rabbit. Some predation entails venom that subdues a prey creature before the predator ingests the prey by killing, which the",
        "Israelites enjoyed political independence twice in ancient history, first during the periods of the Biblical judges followed by the United Monarchy.[disputed – discuss] After the fall of the United Monarchy the land was divided into Israel and Judah. The term Jew originated from the Roman \"Judean\" and denoted someone from the southern kingdom of Judah. The shift of ethnonym from \"Israelites\" to \"Jews\" (inhabitant of Judah), although not contained in the Torah, is made explicit in the Book of Esther (4th century BCE), a book in the Ketuvim, the third section of the Jewish Tanakh. In 587 BC Nebuchadnezzar II, King of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, besieged Jerusalem, destroyed the First Temple, and deported the most prominent citizens of Judah. In 586 BC, Judah itself ceased to be an independent kingdom, and its remaining Jews were left stateless.

        "Van Praag states that the Ming court established diplomatic delegations with Tibet merely to secure urgently needed horses. Wang and Nyima argue that these were not diplomatic delegations at all, that Tibetan areas were ruled by the Ming since Tibetan leaders were granted positions as Ming officials, that horses were collected from Tibet as a mandatory \"corvée\" tax, and therefore Tibetans were \"undertaking domestic affairs, not foreign diplomacy\". Sperling writes that the Ming simultaneously bought horses in the Kham region while fighting Tibetan tribes in Amdo and receiving Tibetan embassies in Nanjing. He also argues that the embassies of Tibetan lamas visiting the Ming court were for the most part efforts to promote commercial transactions between the lamas' large, wealthy entourage and Ming Chinese merchants and officials. Kolmaš writes that while the Ming maintained a laissez-faire policy towards Tibet and limited the numbers of the Tibetan retinues, the Tibetans sought to maintain a tributary relationship with the Ming because imperial patronage",

Puyi, the oldest son of Zaifeng, Prince Chun, and nephew to the childless Guangxu Emperor, was appointed successor at the age of two, leaving Zaifeng with the regency. This was followed by the dismissal of General Yuan Shikai from his former positions of power. In April 1911 Zaifeng created a cabinet in which there were two vice-premiers. Nonetheless, this cabinet was also known by contemporaries as \"The Royal Cabinet\" because among the thirteen cabinet members, five",
        "Plumage is regularly moulted; the standard plumage of a bird that has moulted after breeding is known as the \"non-breeding\" plumage, or—in the Humphrey-Parkes terminology—\"basic\" plumage; breeding plumages or variations of the basic plumage are known under the Humphrey-Parkes system as \"alternate\" plumages. Moulting is annual in most species, although some may have two moults a year, and large birds of prey may moult only once every few years. Moulting patterns vary across species. In passerines, flight feathers are replaced one at a time with the innermost primary being the first. When the fifth of sixth primary is replaced, the outermost tertiaries begin to drop. After the innermost tertiaries are moulted, the secondaries starting from the innermost begin to drop and this proceeds to the outer feathers (centrifugal moult). The greater primary coverts are moulted in synchrony with the primary that they overlap. A small number of species, such as",

Anthropomorphic figurines have been found in the Balkans from 6000 BC, and in Central Europe by c. 5800 BC (La Hoguette). Among the earliest cultural complexes of this area are the Sesklo culture in Thessaly, which later expanded in the Balkans giving rise to Starčevo-Körös (Cris), Linearbandkeramik, and Vinča. Through a combination of cultural diffusion and migration of peoples, the Neolithic traditions spread west and northwards to reach northwestern Europe by around 4500 BC. The Vinča culture may have created the earliest system of writing, the Vinča signs, though archaeologist Shan Winn believes they most likely represented pictograms and ideograms rather than a truly developed form of writing.",

In 2001, Gaddafi condemned the September 11 attacks on the U.S. by al-Qaeda, expressing sympathy with the victims and calling for Libyan involvement in the War on Terror against militant Islamism. His government continued suppressing domestic Islamism, at the same time as Gaddafi called for the wider application of sharia law. Libya also cemented connections with China and North Korea, being visited by Chinese President Jiang Zemin in April 2002. Influenced by the events of the Iraq War, in December 2003, Libya renounced its possession of weapons of mass destruction, decommissioning its chemical and nuclear weapons programs. Relations with the U.S. improved as a result, while UK Prime Minister Tony Blair met with Gaddafi in the Libyan desert in March 2004.

Schools started forming in the area before it was officially a territory as families started settling into the area. The first schools were subscription schools that typically held in the teacher's home. The first formal school on record was at Fort Owen in Bitterroot valley in 1862. The students were Indian children and the children of Fort Owen employees. The first school term started in early winter and only lasted until February 28. Classes were taught by Mr. Robinson. Another early subscription school was started by Thomas Dimsdale in Virginia City in 1863. In this school students were charged $1.75 per week.

Most theories on self-esteem state that there is a grand desire, across all genders and ages, to maintain, protect and enhance their self-esteem. Contrary to popular belief, there is no empirical evidence for a significant drop in self-esteem over the course of adolescence. \"Barometric self-esteem\" fluctuates rapidly and can cause severe distress and anxiety, but baseline self-esteem remains highly stable across adolescence. The validity of global self-esteem scales has been questioned, and many suggest that more specific scales might reveal more about the adolescent experience. Girls are most likely to enjoy high self-esteem when engaged in supportive relationships with friends, the most important function of friendship to them is having someone who can provide social and moral support.

There is effectively no ethnic distinction between black and white Bermudians, other than those characterising recent immigrant communities. In the 17th century, this was not so. For the first hundred years of settlement, white Protestants of English heritage were the distinct majority, with white minorities of Irish (the native language of many of whom can be assumed to have been Gaelic) and Scots sent to Bermuda after the English invasions of their homelands that followed the English Civil War. Non-white minorities included Spanish-speaking, free (indentured) blacks from the West Indies, black chattel slaves primarily captured from Spanish and Portuguese ships by Bermudian privateers, and Native Americans, primarily from the Algonquian and other tribes of the Atlantic seaboard, but possibly from as far away as Mexico. By the 19th century, the white ethnically-English Bermudians had lost their numerical advantage. Despite",

Apple concluded that Intel's CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer) architecture ultimately would not be able to compete against RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) processors. While the Motorola 68040 offered the same features as the Intel 80486 and could on a clock-for-clock basis significantly outperform the Intel chip, the 486 had the ability to be clocked significantly faster without suffering from overheating problems, especially the clock-doubled i486DX2 which ran the CPU logic at twice the external bus speed, giving such equipped IBM compatible systems a significant performance lead over their Macintosh equivalents. Apple's product design and engineering didn't help matters as they restricted the use of the '040 to their expensive Quadras for a time while the 486 was readily available to OEMs as well as enthusiasts who put together their own machines.

Neutral Sections usually consist of an earthed section of wire which is separated from the live wires on either side by insulating material, typically ceramic beads, designed so that the pantograph will smoothly run from one section to the other.

It was dominated by efforts to regain the dignity and classicism of imperial Roman and Byzantine art, but was also influenced by the Insular art of the British Isles. Insular art integrated the energy of Irish Celtic and Anglo-Saxon Germanic styles of ornament with Mediterranean forms such as the book, and established many characteristics of art for the rest of the medieval period. Surviving religious works from the Early Middle Ages are mostly illuminated manuscripts and carved ivories, originally made for metalwork that has since been melted down. Objects in precious metals were the most prestigious form of art, but almost all are lost except for a few crosses such as the Cross of Lothair, several reliquaries, and finds such as the Anglo-Saxon burial at Sutton Hoo and the hoards of Gourdon from Merovingian France, Guarrazar from Visigothic Spain and Nagyszentmiklós near Byzantine",

Soils usually need to be fairly heavy, although the level of nutrients does not need to be exceptional. In general, these conditions are met within the seasonally dry tropics and subtropics in the Northern and Southern hemispheres, but a large proportion of the cotton grown today is cultivated in areas with less rainfall that obtain the water from irrigation. Production of the crop for a given year usually starts soon after harvesting the preceding autumn. Cotton is naturally a perennial but is grown as an annual to help control pests.

        "The book was widely translated in Darwin's lifetime, but problems arose with translating concepts and metaphors, and some translations were biased by the translator's own agenda. Darwin distributed presentation copies in France and Germany, hoping that suitable applicants would come forward, as translators were expected to make their own arrangements with a local publisher. He welcomed the distinguished elderly naturalist and geologist Heinrich Georg Bronn, but the German translation published in 1860 imposed Bronn's own ideas, adding controversial themes that Darwin had deliberately omitted. Bronn translated \"favoured races\" as \"perfected races\", and added essays on issues including the origin of life, as well as a final chapter on religious implications partly inspired by Bronn's adherence to Naturphilosophie.

They faced a powerful rival in the Dukes of Normandy, who in 1066 under William the Conqueror (duke 1035–1087), conquered England (r. 1066–87) and created a cross-channel empire that lasted, in various forms, throughout the rest of the Middle Ages. Normans also settled in Sicily and southern Italy, when Robert Guiscard (d. 1085) landed there in 1059 and established a duchy that later became the Kingdom of Sicily.

        "In 2009, IGN named the Xbox 360 the sixth-greatest video game console of all time, out of a field of 25. Although not the best-selling console of the seventh-generation, the Xbox 360 was deemed by TechRadar to be the most influential, by emphasizing digital media distribution and online gaming through Xbox Live, and by popularizing game achievement awards. PC Magazine considered the Xbox 360 the prototype for online gaming as it \"proved that online gaming communities could thrive in the console space\". Five years after the Xbox 360's original debut, the well-received Kinect motion capture camera was released, which set the record of being the fastest selling consumer electronic device in history, and extended the life of the console. Edge ranked Xbox 360 the second-best console of the 1993–2013 period, stating \"It had its own social network, cross-game chat, new indie games every week, and the best version of just about every multiformat game...Killzone is no Halo and nowadays Gran Turismo is no Forza, but it's",
        "Vladimir had been prince of Novgorod when his father Sviatoslav I died in 972. He was forced to flee to Scandinavia in 976 after his half-brother Yaropolk had murdered his other brother Oleg and taken control of Rus. In Scandinavia, with the help of his relative Earl Håkon Sigurdsson, ruler of Norway, Vladimir assembled a Viking army and reconquered Novgorod and Kiev from Yaropolk. As Prince of Kiev, Vladimir's most notable achievement was the Christianization of Kievan Rus', a process that began in 988. The Primary Chronicle states that when Vladimir had decided to accept a new faith instead of the traditional idol-worship (paganism) of the Slavs, he sent out some of his most valued advisors and warriors as emissaries to different parts of Europe. They visited the Christians",
        "Galicia was spared the worst of the fighting in that war: it was one of the areas where the initial coup attempt at the outset of the war was successful, and it remained in Nationalist (Franco's army's) hands throughout the war. While there were no pitched battles, there was repression and death: all political parties were abolished, as were all labor unions and Galician nationalist organizations as the Seminario de Estudos Galegos. Galicia's statute of autonomy was annulled (as were those of Catalonia and the Basque provinces once those were conquered). According to Carlos Fernández Santander, at least 4,200 people were killed either extrajudicially or after summary trials, among them republicans, communists, Galician nationalists, socialists and anarchists. Victims included the civil governors of all four Galician provinces; Juana Capdevielle, the wife of the governor of A Coruña; mayors such as Ánxel Casal of Santiago de Compostela, of the Partido Galeguista; prominent socialists",
        "Most fatty acids are non-essential, meaning the body can produce them as needed, generally from other fatty acids and always by expending energy to do so. However, in humans, at least two fatty acids are essential and must be included in the diet. An appropriate balance of essential fatty acids—omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids—seems also important for health, although definitive experimental demonstration has been elusive. Both of these \"omega\" long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids are substrates for a class of eicosanoids known as prostaglandins, which have roles throughout the human body. They are hormones, in some respects. The omega-3 eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), which can be made in the human body from the omega-3 essential fatty acid alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), or taken in through marine food sources, serves as a building block for series 3 prostaglandins (e.g., weakly inflammatory PGE3). The omega-6 dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA) serves as a building block for series 1",
        "Public priests were appointed by the collegia. Once elected, a priest held permanent religious authority from the eternal divine, which offered him lifetime influence, privilege and immunity. Therefore, civil and religious law limited the number and kind of religious offices allowed an individual and his family. Religious law was collegial and traditional; it informed political decisions, could overturn them, and was difficult to exploit for personal gain. Priesthood was a costly honour: in traditional Roman practice, a priest drew no stipend. Cult donations were the property of the deity, whose priest must provide cult regardless of shortfalls in public funding – this could mean subsidy of acolytes and all other cult maintenance from personal funds. For those who had reached their goal in the Cursus honorum, permanent priesthood was best sought or granted after a lifetime's service in military or political life, or preferably both:",

        "Darwin was hard at work on his \"big book\" on Natural Selection, when on 18 June 1858 he received a parcel from Wallace, who stayed on the Maluku Islands (Ternate and Gilolo). It enclosed twenty pages describing an evolutionary mechanism, a response to Darwin's recent encouragement, with a request to send it on to Lyell if Darwin thought it worthwhile. The mechanism was similar to Darwin's own theory. Darwin wrote to Lyell that \"your words have come true with a vengeance, ... forestalled\" and he would \"of course, at once write and offer to send [it] to any journal\" that Wallace chose, adding that \"all my originality, whatever it may amount to, will be smashed\". Lyell and Hooker agreed that a joint publication putting together Wallace's pages with extracts from Darwin's 1844 Essay and his 1857 letter to Gray should be presented at the Linnean Society, and on 1 July 1858, the papers entitled On the Tendency",

        "Many modern specialty matches have been devised, with unique winning conditions. The most common of these is the ladder match. In the basic ladder match, the wrestlers or teams of wrestlers must climb a ladder to obtain a prize that is hoisted above the ring. The key to winning this match is that the wrestler or team of wrestlers must try to incapacitate each other long enough for one wrestler to climb the ladder and secure that prize for their team. As a result, the ladder can be used as a weapon. The prizes include – but are not limited to any given championship belt (the traditional prize), a document granting the winner the right to a future title shot, or any document that matters to the wrestlers involved in the match (such as one granting the winner a cash prize). Another common specialty match is known as the battle royal. In a battle royal, all the wrestlers enter the ring to the point that there are 20-30 wrestlers in the ring at one time. When the match begins, the simple",

He was defeated in 288 BC when Lysimachus of Thrace and Pyrrhus of Epirus invaded Macedon on two fronts, and quickly carved up the kingdom for themselves. Demetrius fled to central Greece with his mercenaries and began to build support there and in the northern Peloponnese. He once again laid siege to Athens after they turned on him, but then struck a treaty with the Athenians and Ptolemy, which allowed him to cross over to Asia minor and wage war on Lysimachus' holdings in Ionia, leaving his son Antigonus Gonatas in Greece. After initial successes, he was forced to surrender to Seleucus in 285 and later died in captivity. Lysimachus, who",
        "The first significant work that expressed scientific theory and knowledge expressly for the laity, in the vernacular, and with the entertainment of readers in mind, was Bernard de Fontenelle's Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds (1686). The book was produced specifically for women with an interest in scientific writing and inspired a variety of similar works. These popular works were written in a discursive style, which was laid out much more clearly for the reader than the complicated articles, treatises, and books published by the academies and scientists. Charles Leadbetter's Astronomy (1727) was advertised as \"a Work entirely New\" that would include \"short and easie [sic] Rules and Astronomical Tables.\" The first French introduction to Newtonianism and the Principia was Eléments de la philosophie de Newton, published by Voltaire in 1738. Émilie du Châtelet's translation of the Principia, published after her death in 1756, also helped to spread Newton's theories beyond scientific academies and the university. Francesco Algarotti,",
        "In 633 AD, Rashidun Arabs invaded Iran and conquered it by 651 AD, largely converting Iranian people from their indigenous faiths of Manichaeism and Zoroastrianism to Sunni Islam. Arabic replaced Persian as the official language, while Persian remained the language of both ordinary people and of literature. Iran became a major contributor to the Islamic Golden Age, producing many influential scientists, scholars, artists, and thinkers. Establishment of the Safavid Dynasty in 1501, converted the Iranian people from Sunni Islam to Twelver Shia Islam, and made Twelver Shia Islam the official religion of Iran. Safavid conversion of Iran from Sunnism to Shiism marked one of the most important turning points in Iranian and Muslim history. Starting in 1736 under Nader Shah, Iran reached its greatest territorial extent since the Sassanid Empire, briefly possessing what was arguably the most powerful empire at the time. During the 19th century, Iran irrevocably lost swaths of its territories in the Caucasus which made part of the concept of Iran for centuries, to neighboring Imperial Russia.

        "A government report covered by the Guardian in 2002 indicates that between 1940 and 1979, the Ministry of Defence \"turned large parts of the country into a giant laboratory to conduct a series of secret germ warfare tests on the public\" and many of these tests \"involved releasing potentially dangerous chemicals and micro-organisms over vast swaths of the population without the public being told.\" The Ministry of Defence claims that these trials were to simulate germ warfare and that the tests were harmless. Still, families who have been in the area of many of the tests are experiencing children with birth defects and physical and mental handicaps and many are asking for a public inquiry. According to the report these tests affected estimated millions of people including one period between 1961 and 1968 where \"more than a million people along the south coast of England, from Torquay to the New Forest, were exposed to bacteria including e.coli and bacillus globigii, which mimics anthrax.\" Two",
        "The opening years of the 1980s saw a number of changes in personnel and direction of established hard rock acts, including the deaths of Bon Scott, the lead singer of AC/DC, and John Bonham, drummer with Led Zeppelin. Whereas Zeppelin broke up almost immediately afterwards, AC/DC pressed on, recording the album Back in Black (1980) with their new lead singer, Brian Johnson. It became the fifth-highest-selling album of all time in the US and the second-highest-selling album in the world. Black Sabbath had split with original singer Ozzy Osbourne in 1979 and replaced him with Ronnie James Dio, formerly of Rainbow, giving the band a new sound and a period of creativity and popularity beginning with Heaven and Hell (1980). Osbourne embarked on a solo career with Blizzard of Ozz (1980), featuring American guitarist Randy Rhoads. Some bands, such as Queen, moved away from their hard rock roots and more towards pop rock, while others, including",
        "From his diagrams of a small number of particles interacting in spacetime, Feynman could then model all of physics in terms of the spins of those particles and the range of coupling of the fundamental forces. Feynman attempted an explanation of the strong interactions governing nucleons scattering called the parton model. The parton model emerged as a complement to the quark model developed by his Caltech colleague Murray Gell-Mann. The relationship between the two models was murky; Gell-Mann referred to Feynman's partons derisively as \"put-ons\". In the mid-1960s, physicists believed that quarks were just a bookkeeping device for symmetry numbers, not real particles, as the statistics of the Omega-minus particle, if it were interpreted as three identical strange quarks bound together, seemed impossible if quarks were real. The Stanford linear accelerator deep inelastic scattering experiments of the late 1960s showed, analogously to Ernest Rutherford's experiment of scattering alpha particles on gold nuclei in",

        "Before the early 20th century, treatments for infections were based primarily on medicinal folklore. Mixtures with antimicrobial properties that were used in treatments of infections were described over 2000 years ago. Many ancient cultures, including the ancient Egyptians and ancient Greeks, used specially selected mold and plant materials and extracts to treat infections. More recent observations made in the laboratory of antibiosis between microorganisms led to the discovery of natural antibacterials produced by microorganisms. Louis Pasteur observed, \"if we could intervene in the antagonism observed between some bacteria, it would offer perhaps the greatest hopes for therapeutics\". The term 'antibiosis', meaning \"against life\", was introduced by the French bacteriologist Jean Paul Vuillemin as a descriptive name of the phenomenon exhibited by these early antibacterial drugs. Antibiosis was first described in 1877 in bacteria when Louis Pasteur",

This has been an emerging trend in the politics of the Republic of Ireland since the 1980s and is almost always the case in Germany on national and state level, and in most constituencies at the communal level. Furthermore, since the forming of the Republic of Iceland there has never been a government not led by a coalition (usually of the Independence Party and one other (often the Social Democratic Alliance). A similar situation exists in the Republic of Ireland; since 1989, no one party has held power on its own. Since then, numerous coalition governments have been formed.

The subsequent 17th century was one of political upheaval, religious division and war. English colonialism in Ireland of the 16th century was extended by large-scale Scottish and English colonies in Ulster. Religious division heightened and the King in England came into conflict with parliament. A prime issue was, inter alia, over his policy of tolerance towards Catholicism. The resulting English Civil War or War of the Three Kingdoms led to a revolutionary republic in England. Ireland, largely Catholic was mainly loyal to the king. Following defeat to the parliaments army, large scale land distributions from loyalist Irish nobility to English commoners in the service of the parliamentary army created the beginnings a new Ascendancy class which over the next hundred years would obliterate the English (Hiberno-Norman) and Gaelic Irish",

The Marathas continued their military campaigns against Mughals, Nizam, Nawab of Bengal and Durrani Empire to further extend their boundaries. Gordon explained how the Maratha systematically took control over new regions. They would start with annual raids, followed by collecting ransom from villages and towns while the declining Mughal Empire retained nominal control and finally taking over the region.

The majority of the names on the list belonged to Issei community leaders, as the FBI investigation built on an existing Naval Intelligence index that had focused on Japanese Americans in Hawaii and the West Coast, but many German and Italian nationals also found their way onto the secret list. Robert Shivers, head of the Honolulu office, obtained permission from Hoover to start detaining those on the list on December 7, 1941, while bombs were still falling over Pearl Harbor. Mass arrests and searches of homes (in most cases conducted without warrants) began a few hours after the attack, and over the next several weeks more than 5,500 Issei men were taken into FBI custody.

        "The body’s capability to react to antigen depends on a person's age, antigen type, maternal factors and the area where the antigen is presented. Neonates are said to be in a state of physiological immunodeficiency, because both their innate and adaptive immunological responses are greatly suppressed. Once born, a child’s immune system responds favorably to protein antigens while not as well to glycoproteins and polysaccharides. In fact, many of the infections acquired by neonates are caused by low virulence organisms like Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas. In neonates, opsonic activity and the ability to activate the complement cascade is very limited. For example, the mean level of C3 in a newborn is approximately 65% of that found in the adult. Phagocytic activity is also greatly impaired in newborns. This is due to lower opsonic activity, as well as diminished up-regulation of integrin and selectin receptors, which limit the ability of neutrophils to interact with adhesion molecules in the endothelium.

        "A standard adult football match consists of two periods of 45 minutes each, known as halves. Each half runs continuously, meaning that the clock is not stopped when the ball is out of play. There is usually a 15-minute half-time break between halves. The end of the match is known as full-time. The referee is the official timekeeper for the match, and may make an allowance for time lost through substitutions, injured players requiring attention, or other stoppages. This added time is called additional time in FIFA documents, but is most commonly referred to as stoppage time or injury time, while loss time can also be used as a synonym. The duration of stoppage time is at the sole discretion of the referee. The referee alone signals the end of the match. In matches where a fourth official is appointed, toward the end of the half the referee signals how many minutes of stoppage time he intends to add. The fourth official then informs the players and spectators by holding up a board",

For example, in the early 1980s, prior to the appearance of AZT for the treatment of AIDS, the course of the disease was closely followed by monitoring the composition of patient blood samples, even though the outcome would not offer the patient any further treatment options. In part, these studies on the appearance of HIV in specific communities permitted the advancement of hypotheses as to the route of transmission of the virus. By understanding how the disease was transmitted, resources could be targeted to the communities at greatest risk in campaigns aimed at reducing the number of new infections. The specific serological diagnostic identification, and later genotypic or molecular identification, of HIV also enabled the development of hypotheses as to the temporal and geographical origins",

The first parties were called Federalist and Republican, followed by a brief period of Republican dominance before a split occurred between National Republicans and Democratic Republicans. The former became the Whig Party and the latter became the Democratic Party. The Whigs survived only for two decades before they split over the spread of slavery, those opposed becoming members of the new Republican Party, as did anti-slavery members of the Democratic Party. Third parties (such as the Libertarian Party) often receive little support and are very rarely the victors in elections.

        "Of the 80 torch-bearers in London, Sir Steve Redgrave, who started the relay, mentioned to the media that he had received e-mailed pleas to boycott the event and could \"see why they would like to make an issue\" of it. Francesca Martinez and Richard Vaughan refused to carry the torch, while Konnie Huq decided to carry it and also speak out against China. The pro-Tibetan Member of Parliament Norman Baker asked all bearers to reconsider. Amid pressure from both directions, Prime Minister Gordon Brown welcomed the torch outside 10 Downing Street without holding or touching it. The London relay saw the torch surrounded by what the BBC described as \"a mobile protective ring.\" Protests began as soon as Redgrave started the event, leading to at least thirty-five arrests. In Ladbroke Grove a demonstrator attempted to snatch the torch from Konnie Huq in a momentary struggle, and in a separate incident, a fire extinguisher was set off near the torch. The Chinese ambassador carried the torch through Chinatown after",

Mechanical typewriters followed the standard set by the Remington No. 2 (1878), the first typewriter with a shift key, and the shifted values of 23456789- were \"#$%_&'() – early typewriters omitted 0 and 1, using O (capital letter o) and l (lowercase letter L) instead, but 1! and 0) pairs became standard once 0 and 1 became common. Thus, in ASCII !\"#$% were placed in second column, rows 1–5, corresponding to the digits 1–5 in the adjacent column. The parentheses could not correspond to 9 and 0, however, because the place corresponding to 0 was taken by the space character. This was accommodated by removing _ (underscore) from",
        "Adolescence marks a rapid change in one's role within a family. Young children tend to assert themselves forcefully, but are unable to demonstrate much influence over family decisions until early adolescence, when they are increasingly viewed by parents as equals. The adolescent faces the task of increasing independence while preserving a caring relationship with his or her parents. When children go through puberty, there is often a significant increase in parent–child conflict and a less cohesive familial bond. Arguments often concern minor issues of control, such as curfew, acceptable clothing, and the adolescent's right to privacy, which adolescents may have previously viewed as issues over which their parents had complete authority. Parent-adolescent disagreement also increases as friends demonstrate a greater impact on one another, new influences on the adolescent that may be in opposition to parents' values. Social media has also played an increasing role in adolescent and parent disagreements. While parents never had to worry about the threats of social",
        "Microbiological culture is a principal tool used to diagnose infectious disease. In a microbial culture, a growth medium is provided for a specific agent. A sample taken from potentially diseased tissue or fluid is then tested for the presence of an infectious agent able to grow within that medium. Most pathogenic bacteria are easily grown on nutrient agar, a form of solid medium that supplies carbohydrates and proteins necessary for growth of a bacterium, along with copious amounts of water. A single bacterium will grow into a visible mound on the surface of the plate called a colony, which may be separated from other colonies or melded together into a \"lawn\". The size, color, shape and form of a colony is characteristic of the bacterial species, its specific genetic makeup (its strain), and the environment that supports its growth. Other ingredients are often added to the plate to aid in identification. Plates may contain substances that permit the growth of some bacteria",

The recent Head Master, Tony Little, said that Eton is developing plans to allow any boy to attend the school whatever his parents' income and, in 2011, said that around 250 boys received \"significant\" financial help from the school. In early 2014, this figure had risen to 263 pupils receiving the equivalent of around 60% of school fee assistance, whilst a further 63 received their education free of charge.

Freddie Mercury (then known by his birth name of Farrokh \"Freddie\" Bulsara) was a fan of Smile and encouraged them to experiment with more elaborate stage and recording techniques. Mercury joined the band in 1970, suggested \"Queen\" as a new band name, and adopted his familiar stage name. John Deacon was recruited prior to recording their eponymous debut album in 1973. Queen first charted in the UK with their second album, Queen II, in 1974, but it was the release of Sheer Heart Attack later that year and A Night at the Opera in 1975 which brought them international success. The latter featured \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", which stayed at number one in the UK for nine weeks and popularised the music video.

Plymouth was attacked five times before the end of the month while Belfast, Hull, and Cardiff were hit. Cardiff was bombed on three nights, Portsmouth centre was devastated by five raids. The rate of civilian housing lost was averaging 40,000 people per week dehoused in September 1940. In March 1941, two raids on Plymouth and London dehoused 148,000 people. Still, while heavily damaged, British ports continued to support war industry and supplies from North America continued to pass through them while the Royal Navy continued to operate in Plymouth, Southampton, and Portsmouth. Plymouth in particular, because of its vulnerable position on the south coast and close proximity to German air bases, was subjected to the heaviest attacks. On 10/11 March, 240 bombers dropped 193 tons of high explosives and 46,000 incendiaries. Many houses and commercial centres were heavily",
        "It is not clear exactly where collegiate a cappella began. The Rensselyrics of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (formerly known as the RPI Glee Club), established in 1873 is perhaps the oldest known collegiate a cappella group.[citation needed] However the longest continuously-singing group is probably The Whiffenpoofs of Yale University, which was formed in 1909 and once included Cole Porter as a member. Collegiate a cappella groups grew throughout the 20th century. Some notable historical groups formed along the way include Princeton University's Tigertones (1946), Colgate University's The Colgate 13 (1942), Dartmouth College's Aires (1946), Cornell University's Cayuga's Waiters (1949) and The Hangovers (1968), the University of Maine Maine Steiners (1958), the Columbia University Kingsmen (1949), the Jabberwocks of Brown University (1949), and the University of Rochester YellowJackets (1956).

        "Communication within peer groups allows adolescents to explore their feelings and identity as well as develop and evaluate their social skills. Peer groups offer members the opportunity to develop social skills such as empathy, sharing, and leadership. Adolescents choose peer groups based on characteristics similarly found in themselves. By utilizing these relationships, adolescents become more accepting of who they are becoming. Group norms and values are incorporated into an adolescent’s own self-concept. Through developing new communication skills and reflecting upon those of their peers, as well as self-opinions and values, an adolescent can share and express emotions and other concerns without fear of rejection or judgment. Peer groups can have positive influences on an individual, such as on academic motivation and performance. However, while peers may facilitate social development for one another they may also hinder it. Peers can have negative influences, such as encouraging experimentation with drugs, drinking, vandalism, and stealing through peer pressure. Susceptibility to peer pressure increases during early adolescence, peaks around age 14, and declines thereafter. Further evidence of peers",

The Australian economy was facing the early 1990s recession. Unemployment reached 11.4% in 1992. Under Dr John Hewson, in November 1991, the opposition launched the 650-page Fightback! policy document − a radical collection of \"dry\", economic liberal measures including the introduction of a Goods and Services Tax (GST), various changes to Medicare including the abolition of bulk billing for non-concession holders, the introduction of a nine-month limit on unemployment benefits, various changes to industrial relations including the abolition of awards, a $13 billion personal income tax cut directed at middle and upper income earners, $10 billion in government spending cuts, the abolition of state payroll taxes and the privatisation of a large number of government owned enterprises − representing the start of a very different future direction to the keynesian economic conservatism practiced by previous Liberal/National Coalition governments.

The opening quote by the 19th-century essayist Charles Lamb reads: \"Lawyers, I suppose, were children once.\" Johnson notes that even in Scout and Jem's childhood world, compromises and treaties are struck with each other by spitting on one's palm and laws are discussed by Atticus and his children: is it right that Bob Ewell hunts and traps out of season?

        "In late 1975, Queen recorded and released A Night at the Opera, taking its name from the popular Marx Brothers movie. At the time, it was the most expensive album ever produced. Like its predecessor, the album features diverse musical styles and experimentation with stereo sound. In \"The Prophet's Song\", an eight-minute epic, the middle section is a canon, with simple phrases layered to create a full-choral sound. The Mercury penned ballad, \"Love of My Life\", featured a harp and overdubbed vocal harmonies. The album was very successful in Britain, and went triple platinum in the United States. The British public voted it the 13th greatest album of all time in a 2004 Channel 4 poll. It has also ranked highly in international polls; in a worldwide Guinness poll, it was voted the 19th greatest of all time, while an ABC poll saw the Australian public vote it the 28th greatest of all time.

        "Although the doctrine of Mary's Immaculate Conception appears only later among Latin (and particularly Frankish) theologians, it became ever more manifest among Byzantine theologians reliant on Gregory Nazianzen's Mariology in the Medieval or Byzantine East. Although hymnographers and scholars, like the Emperor Justinian I, were accustomed to call Mary \"prepurified\" in their poetic and credal statements, the first point of departure for more fully commenting on Nazianzen's meaning occurs in Sophronius of Jerusalem. In other places Sophronius explains that the Theotokos was already immaculate, when she was \"purified\" at the Annunciation and goes so far as to note that John the Baptist is literally \"holier than all 'Men' born of woman\" since Mary's surpassing holiness signifies that she was holier than even John after his sanctification in utero. Sophronius' teaching is augmented and incorporated by St. John Damascene (d. 749/750). John, besides many passages wherein he extolls the Theotokos for her purification at the Annunciation, grants her the unique honor of \"purifying the waters of baptism by touching them.\" This",

Members of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China, including pro-democracy activist Szeto Wah, waved novelty inflatable plastic Olympic flames, which they said symbolised democracy. They wanted accountability for the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 and the implementation of democracy in Hong Kong. Political activist and Legislative Council member Leung Kwok-hung (Longhair) also joined the protest, saying \"I'm very proud that in Hong Kong we still have people brave enough to speak out.\" Pro-democracy activists were overwhelmed by a crowd of torch supporters with insults like \"running dog,\" \"traitor,\" \"get out!,\" and \"I love the Communist Party.\" At the same time, about 10 members of the Civil Human Rights Front had orange banners calling for human rights improvements and universal suffrage.

        "Zhejiang's main manufacturing sectors are electromechanical industries, textiles, chemical industries, food, and construction materials. In recent years Zhejiang has followed its own development model, dubbed the \"Zhejiang model\", which is based on prioritizing and encouraging entrepreneurship, an emphasis on small businesses responsive to the whims of the market, large public investments into infrastructure, and the production of low-cost goods in bulk for both domestic consumption and export. As a result, Zhejiang has made itself one of the richest provinces, and the \"Zhejiang spirit\" has become something of a legend within China. However, some economists now worry that this model is not sustainable, in that it is inefficient and places unreasonable demands on raw materials and public utilities, and also a dead end, in that the myriad small businesses in Zhejiang producing cheap goods in bulk are unable to move to more sophisticated or technologically more advanced industries.",

As İnalcık mentions: \"Those which aid religion are good and sciences like astrology are bad.\" However, even though mathematics, or studies in logic were part of the madrasa's curriculum, they were all centred around religion. Even mathematics had a religious impulse behind its teachings. \"The Ulema of the Ottoman medreses held the view that hostility to logic and mathematics was futile since these accustomed the mind to correct thinking and thus helped to reveal divine truths\" – key word being \"divine\".

Galicia was incorporated into the Roman Empire at the end of the Cantabrian Wars in 19 BC, being turned into a Roman province in the 3rd century AD. In 410, the Germanic Suebi established a kingdom with its capital in Braga (Portugal) which was incorporated into that of the Visigoths in 585. In 711, the Arabs invaded the Iberian Peninsula, taking the Visigoth kingdom, but soon in 740 Galicia was incorporated into the Christian kingdom of Asturias. During the Middle Ages, the kingdom of Galicia was occasionally ruled by its own kings, but most of the time it was leagued to the kingdom",

Game Informer called it \"so creative that it rivals the best that Hollywood has to offer\". GamesRadar praised Twilight Princess as \"a game that deserves nothing but the absolute highest recommendation\". Cubed3 hailed Twilight Princess as \"the single greatest videogame experience\". Twilight Princess's graphics were praised for the art style and animation, although the game was designed for the GameCube, which is technically lacking compared to the next generation consoles. Both IGN and GameSpy pointed out the existence of blurry textures and low-resolution characters. Despite these complaints, Computer and Video Games felt the game's atmosphere was superior to that of any previous Zelda game, and regarded Twilight Princess's Hyrule as the best version ever created. PALGN praised the game's cinematics, noting that \"the cutscenes are the best",

        "Though Britain and the empire emerged victorious from the Second World War, the effects of the conflict were profound, both at home and abroad. Much of Europe, a continent that had dominated the world for several centuries, was in ruins, and host to the armies of the United States and the Soviet Union, who now held the balance of global power. Britain was left essentially bankrupt, with insolvency only averted in 1946 after the negotiation of a $US 4.33 billion loan (US$56 billion in 2012) from the United States, the last instalment of which was repaid in 2006. At the same time, anti-colonial movements were on the rise in the colonies of European nations. The situation was complicated further by the increasing Cold War rivalry of the United States and the Soviet Union. In principle, both nations were opposed to European colonialism. In practice, however, American anti-communism prevailed over anti-imperialism, and therefore the United States supported the continued existence of the British Empire to keep Communist expansion in",

The Parian Chronicle says that Phthia was the homeland of the Hellenes and that this name was given to those previously called Greeks (Γραικοί). In Greek mythology, Hellen, the patriarch of Hellenes, was son of Pyrrha and Deucalion, who ruled around Phthia, the only survivors after the great deluge. It seems that the myth was invented when the Greek tribes started to separate from each other in certain areas of Greece and it indicates their common origin. Aristotle names ancient Hellas as an",

With the German occupation of Western Europe, the intensification of submarine and air attack on Britain's sea communications was feared by the British. Such an event would have serious consequences on the future course of the war, should the Germans succeed. Liverpool and its port became an important destination for convoys heading through the Western Approaches from North America, bringing supplies and materials.

This new, refaced principal façade (of Portland stone) was designed to be the backdrop to the Victoria Memorial, a large memorial statue of Queen Victoria, placed outside the main gates. George V, who had succeeded Edward VII in 1910, had a more serious personality than his father; greater emphasis was now placed on official entertaining and royal duties than on lavish parties. He arranged a series of command performances featuring jazz musicians such as the Original Dixieland Jazz Band (1919) – the first jazz performance for a head of state, Sidney Bechet, and Louis Armstrong (1932), which earned the palace a nomination in 2009 for a (Kind of) Blue Plaque by the Brecon Jazz Festival as one of the venues making the greatest contribution to jazz music in the United Kingdom.",
        "The brief peace in Europe allowed Napoleon to focus on the French colonies abroad. Saint-Domingue had managed to acquire a high level of political autonomy during the Revolutionary Wars, with Toussaint Louverture installing himself as de facto dictator by 1801. Napoleon saw his chance to recuperate the formerly wealthy colony when he signed the Treaty of Amiens. During the Revolution, the National Convention voted to abolish slavery in February 1794. Under the terms of Amiens, however, Napoleon agreed to appease British demands by not abolishing slavery in any colonies where the 1794 decree had never been implemented. The resulting Law of 20 May never applied to colonies like Guadeloupe or Guyane, even though rogue generals and other officials used the pretext of peace as an opportunity to reinstate slavery in some of these places. The Law of 20 May officially restored the slave trade to the Caribbean colonies, not slavery itself. Napoleon sent an expedition under General Leclerc designed to",
        "Mary's complete sinlessness and concomitant exemption from any taint from the first moment of her existence was a doctrine familiar to Greek theologians of Byzantium. Beginning with St. Gregory Nazianzen, his explanation of the \"purification\" of Jesus and Mary at the circumcision (Luke 2:22) prompted him to consider the primary meaning of \"purification\" in Christology (and by extension in Mariology) to refer to a perfectly sinless nature that manifested itself in glory in a moment of grace (e.g., Jesus at his Baptism). St. Gregory Nazianzen designated Mary as \"prokathartheisa (prepurified).\" Gregory likely attempted to solve the riddle of the Purification of Jesus and Mary in the Temple through considering the human natures of Jesus and Mary as equally holy and therefore both purified in this manner of grace and glory. Gregory's doctrines surrounding Mary's purification were likely related to the burgeoning commemoration of the Mother of God in and around Constantinople very close to the date of Christmas. Nazianzen's title of Mary at the Annunciation as \"prepurified\" was subsequently adopted",

In 1843 the possibility of war was anticipated by the state government and it began to reinforce the defense lines along the political boundary with Texas. Supplies of weapons were sent to fully equip the military and took steps to improve efficiency at the presidios. Later, the Regimen for the Defenders of the Border were organized by the state which were made up of: light cavalry, four squads of two brigades, and a small force of 14 men and 42 officials at the price of 160,603 pesos per year. During the beginning of the 1840s, private citizens took it upon themselves to stop the commercial caravans of supplies from the United States, but being so far away from the large suppliers in central Mexico the caravan was allowed to continue in March 1844.

While one French army approached from the north, the Austrians were busy with another stationed in Genoa, which was besieged by a substantial force. The fierce resistance of this French army, under André Masséna, gave the northern striking force precious time to carry out their operations with little interference. After spending several days looking for each other, the two armies finally collided at the Battle of Marengo on June 14. General Melas had a numerical advantage, fielding about 30,000 Austrian soldiers while Napoleon commanded 24,000 French troops. The battle began favorably for the Austrians as their initial attack surprised the French and gradually drove them back. Melas concluded that he'd",

The myth of Danaus, whose origin is Egypt, is a foundation legend of Argos. His daughters Danaides, were forced in Tartarus to carry a jug to fill a bathtub without a bottom. This myth is connected with a task that can never be fulfilled (Sisyphos) and the name can be derived from the PIE root *danu: \"river\". There is not any satisfactory theory on their origin. Some scholars connect Danaans with the Denyen, one of the groups of the sea peoples who attacked Egypt during the reign of Ramesses III (1187-1156 BCE). The same inscription mentions the Weshesh who might have been the Achaeans. The Denyen seem to have been inhabitants of the city Adana in Cilicia. Pottery similar to",

        "An adolescent's environment plays a huge role in their identity development. While most adolescent studies are conducted on white, middle class children, studies show that the more privileged upbringing people have, the more successfully they develop their identity. The forming of an adolescent's identity is a crucial time in their life. It has been recently found that demographic patterns suggest that the transition to adulthood is now occurring over a longer span of years than was the case during the middle of the 20th century. Accordingly, youth, a period that spans late adolescence and early adulthood, has become a more prominent stage of the life course. This therefore has caused various factors to become important during this development. So many factors contribute to the developing social identity of an adolescent from commitment, to coping devices, to social media. All of these factors are affected by the environment an adolescent grows up in. A child from a more privileged upbringing is exposed to more opportunities and better situations in general.",

        "The relationships adolescents have with their peers, family, and members of their social sphere play a vital role in the social development of an adolescent. As an adolescent's social sphere develops rapidly as they distinguish the differences between friends and acquaintances, they often become heavily emotionally invested in friends. This is not harmful; however, if these friends expose an individual to potentially harmful situations, this is an aspect of peer pressure. Adolescence is a critical period in social development because adolescents can be easily influenced by the people they develop close relationships with. This is the first time individuals can truly make their own decisions, which also makes this a sensitive period. Relationships are vital in the social development of an adolescent due to the extreme influence peers can have over an individual. These relationships become significant because they begin to help the adolescent understand the concept",

        "Some rock musicians today use mandolins, often single-stringed electric models rather than double-stringed acoustic mandolins. One example is Tim Brennan of the Irish-American punk rock band Dropkick Murphys. In addition to electric guitar, bass, and drums, the band uses several instruments associated with traditional Celtic music, including mandolin, tin whistle, and Great Highland bagpipes. The band explains that these instruments accentuate the growling sound they favor. The 1991 R.E.M. hit \"Losing My Religion\" was driven by a few simple mandolin licks played by guitarist Peter Buck, who also played the mandolin in nearly a dozen other songs. The single peaked at No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart (#1 on the rock and alternative charts), Luther Dickinson of North Mississippi Allstars and The Black Crowes has made frequent use of the mandolin, most notably on",
        "Predators are often another organism's prey, and likewise prey are often predators. Though blue jays prey on insects, they may in turn be prey for cats and snakes, and snakes may be the prey of hawks. One way of classifying predators is by trophic level. Organisms that feed on autotrophs, the producers of the trophic pyramid, are known as herbivores or primary consumers; those that feed on heterotrophs such as animals are known as secondary consumers. Secondary consumers are a type of carnivore, but there are also tertiary consumers eating these carnivores, quartary consumers eating them, and so forth. Because only a fraction of energy is passed on to the next level, this hierarchy of predation must end somewhere, and very seldom goes higher than five or six levels, and may go only as high as three trophic levels (for example, a lion that preys upon large herbivores such as wildebeest, which",
        "In 680 Ibn al-Zubayr fled Medina for Mecca. Hearing about Husayn's opposition to Yazid I, the people of Kufa sent to Husayn asking him to take over with their support. Al-Husayn sent his cousin Muslim bin Agail to verify if they would rally behind him. When the news reached Yazid I, he sent Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad, ruler of Basrah, with the instruction to prevent the people of Kufa rallying behind Al-Husayn. Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad managed to disperse the crowd that gathered around Muslim bin Agail and captured him. Realizing Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad had been instructed to prevent Husayn from establishing support in Kufa, Muslim bin Agail requested a message to be sent to Husayn to prevent his immigration to Kufa. The request was denied and Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad",
        "On 1 September 1870, the battle opened with the Army of Châlons, with 202 infantry battalions, 80 cavalry squadrons and 564 guns, attacking the surrounding Prussian Third and Meuse Armies totaling 222 infantry battalions, 186 cavalry squadrons and 774 guns. General De Wimpffen, the commander of the French V Corps in reserve, hoped to launch a combined infantry and cavalry attack against the Prussian XI Corps. But by 11:00, Prussian artillery took a toll on the French while more Prussian troops arrived on the battlefield. The French cavalry, commanded by General Marguerite, launched three desperate attacks on the nearby village of Floing where the Prussian XI Corps was concentrated. Marguerite was killed leading the very first charge and the two additional charges led to nothing but heavy losses. By the end of the day, with no hope of breaking"

        "In the world of birds, a fascinating array of excretory systems exists. Just like the cold-blooded reptiles, our feathered friends primarily rely on a process known as uricotelism. This means that their kidneys work diligently to filter out nitrogenous waste from their blood, ultimately expelling it in the form of uric acid. Unlike us humans, birds lack a urinary bladder or an external urethral opening. Instead, their waste is a curious mix of uric acid and feces, a semisolid combination that is expelled through the cloaca. This versatile opening serves multiple purposes - from waste disposal to egg-laying and even the intimate act of mating. And let's not forget about those pellets that some bird species regurgitate, a unique way of getting rid of indigestible material. It's a reminder that the world of birds is as diverse and intriguing as the skies they soar through.",
        "Mammalian hair, also known as pelage, is a fascinating feature that exhibits a wide range of colors and variations. From light to dark hues, color variation can be observed not only between different populations of mammals but also within the same population and even on individual organisms. While some color differences may be attributed to age variations, other factors such as selective pressures play a significant role in determining the coloration of mammalian pelage. These selective pressures, which can stem from ecological interactions with other populations or environmental conditions, often drive the evolution of specific colors that enhance the chances of survival for the organism. One of the primary selection pressures influencing mammalian coloration is camouflage, as blending in with the surroundings can greatly increase an individual's chances of avoiding predators. However, coloration in mammals can also be influenced by other factors such as sexual selection, communication needs, and physiological processes. Overall, the diverse and adaptive nature of mammalian coloration showcases the intricate balance between survival needs and evolutionary pressures.",

        "Following the fall of Wu and the turmoil of the Wu Hu uprising against the Jin dynasty (265–420), the landscape of China had drastically changed. With the majority of elite Chinese families aligning themselves with the non-Chinese rulers in the north, many found themselves displaced and stripped of their social privileges. Seeking refuge, some of these Chinese refugees made their way south to the regions near the Yangtze River. Among them were the descendants of Zhuge Liang, the renowned chancellor of the state of Shu Han during the Three Kingdoms period. Settling in the outskirts of Hangzhou, they established Zhuge Village, an exclusive community comprising only individuals bearing the family name \"Zhuge\". This village, hidden from the outside world for centuries, maintained a sense of isolation and exclusivity. It is a testament to how a select few powerful and elite Chinese refugees from the Central Plain managed to carve out a new existence in a foreign land, preserving their heritage and identity amidst the chaos of war and political upheaval.",
        "The 1998 season for the Chicago Cubs began on a somber note with the passing of legendary broadcaster Harry Caray. Following the retirements of Ryne Sandberg and the trade of Shawon Dunston, the Cubs had key positions to fill. The signing of Henry Rodríguez, affectionately known as \"H-Rod,\" brought power to the lineup as he hit 31 home runs in his first season in Chicago, providing protection for slugger Sammy Sosa. Kevin Tapani had a standout season with a career-high 19 wins, while closer Rod Beck anchored a solid bullpen. Mark Grace also had an impressive year for the Cubs. The team garnered significant media attention in 1998, with Sosa and rookie pitcher Kerry Wood emerging as the biggest stars. Wood made headlines with his memorable one-hitter game against the Houston Astros, where he tied the MLB record with 20 strikeouts in a single game. His impressive strikeout numbers earned him the nickname \"Kid K\" and the 1998 NL Rookie of the Year award. Sosa also had a remarkable season, setting a major league record in June with 20 home runs.",
        "In today's society, the journey through adolescence is not without its challenges, especially when it comes to navigating the complexities of sexuality. As young people begin to explore their sexual identities, they may encounter various risks and dangers along the way. While issues like emotional distress and the threat of sexually transmitted infections, including HIV/AIDS, are concerns that can affect individuals of any age, the specific risks faced by adolescents are unique. Teenage pregnancy, often the result of inconsistent or ineffective contraceptive use, is a significant social issue in many western countries. Shockingly, statistics show that one in four sexually active teenagers will contract an STI, highlighting the importance of comprehensive sexual education and access to healthcare services for young people. Despite efforts to promote safer sex practices, misconceptions still persist among adolescents, with some mistakenly believing that engaging in activities other than intercourse reduces the risk of STIs. Clinicians across the United States are reporting an increase in cases of herpes and human papillomavirus (HPV), a virus that can lead to genital warts and is now believed to affect as many as 15 percent of adolescents. These alarming trends underscore the importance of providing young people with accurate information and resources to help them make informed decisions about their sexual health.",
        "The development and divergence of the vernacular, literary, and written languages of the South Slavs have been a complex and multifaceted process throughout history. Prior to the 19th century, the various regions and ethnicities had their own distinct languages such as Chakavian, Kajkavian, and Shtokavian, leading to a lack of unified linguistic identity. The terms used to describe these languages were varied, with names like \"Illyric\", \"Slavic\", \"Slavonian\", \"Bosnian\", \"Dalmatian\", \"Serbian\", or \"Croatian\" being used. The term \"Serbo-Croatian\" was first introduced by Jacob Grimm in 1824 and later popularized by Jernej Kopitar in Vienna. Despite efforts by Croatian Zagreb grammarians to establish a unified language in the mid-19th century, the regions of Serb and Croat lands were still under the rule of the Ottoman and Austrian Empires. Various names such as Serbo-Croat, Croato-Serbian, Serbian and Croatian, Croatian and Serbian, Serbian or Croatian, and Croatian or Serbian were used to refer to the language officially. However, unofficially, Serbs and Croats tended to refer to the language as \"Serbian\" or \"Croatian\" respectively, without making a clear distinction between the two. Even in independent Bosnia and Herzegovina, the terms \"Bosnian\", \"Croatian\", and \"Serbian\" were often used interchangeably to describe the same language.",
        "Identity development is a crucial stage in the life cycle of adolescents, typically beginning in their teenage years. This period is characterized by a heightened sense of exploration and experimentation as young individuals navigate the complex process of self-discovery. Adolescents often engage in various behaviors and adopt different appearances as they seek to uncover their true selves. This search for identity involves a series of trials and errors, with individuals cycling through different personas in order to find one that aligns with their authentic self. However, the journey of developing and maintaining one's identity during adolescence is fraught with challenges stemming from various external factors such as family dynamics, environmental influences, and social standing. Research indicates that this process is better described as identity development rather than formation, emphasizing the ongoing nature of this transformative process in terms of both its content and structure.",
        "The vast Seleucid Empire, much like its Egyptian counterpart, was primarily under the influence of a Greco-Macedonian ruling class. The Greek inhabitants of the urban centers, who were at the top of the social hierarchy, were bolstered by immigrants from Greece itself. These urban centers, such as the newly established Antioch and the cities of the Syrian tetrapolis, maintained the traditional structures of Greek city-states, such as assemblies and elected officials. However, this semblance of autonomy was merely a facade, as ultimate control lay in the hands of Seleucid authorities. In addition to these urban centers, the Seleucids strategically placed garrisons, military colonies, and Greek villages throughout their empire to solidify their grip on power. This 'Greco-Macedonian' population, spread across the empire, played a crucial role in maintaining Seleucid dominance.",
        "The implications of identity in various research traditions are vast, with many scholars now utilizing this perspective to examine different phenomena. In the context of occupational settings, the construction of identity plays a crucial role, especially in stigmatized or \"dirty\" jobs. According to Hughes (1951), individuals may face challenges in such roles due to the societal perceptions attached to them. Tracy and Trethewey (2005) highlight how individuals are drawn to or repelled from certain jobs based on how well they align with their desired self-image within the organization. Different occupations come with varying levels of stigma or prestige, which can impact an individual's sense of identity. Tracy's analysis of correctional officers struggling to shed the label of \"glorified maids\" illustrates this point. The process of justifying and valuing one's occupational choices is influenced by factors such as workplace satisfaction and overall quality of life (Tracy & Scott 2006). People working in stigmatized jobs often grapple with these issues as they navigate their professional identities.",
        "Emotions play a crucial role in motivating social interactions and relationships, as they are closely linked to basic physiology, particularly the stress systems. The relationship between emotions and the anti-stress complex, including the oxytocin-attachment system, is significant in fostering bonding among individuals. Additionally, emotional phenotype temperaments have a direct impact on social connectedness and fitness within complex social systems, as noted by Kurt Kortschal in 2013. These traits are not unique to humans but are shared among various species and taxa, indicating a genetic basis for these emotional responses. The genetic information encoded in DNA sequences serves as the blueprint for building proteins that form our cells, with zygotes inheriting genetic information from parental germ cells. With each speciation event, heritable traits that have been advantageous to ancestors are passed down, shaping the emotional responses and social behaviors of individuals within a species.",
        "In the realm of emotions, Stanley Schachter delved deep, building his theory upon the foundation laid by the Spanish physician, Gregorio Marañón. Injecting patients with epinephrine, Marañón probed the connection between physiological reactions and emotional responses. A fascinating discovery emerged - the patients felt something, yet without a clear trigger, they struggled to interpret their heightened bodily sensations as a specific emotion. Schachter, too, recognized the significance of physiological arousal in the realm of emotions. He proposed that these bodily reactions served as a catalyst for a focused cognitive evaluation of the situation at hand, ultimately shaping the subjective emotional experience. Thus, emotions were not merely spontaneous reactions; rather, they unfolded through a two-stage process. First came the general physiological arousal - the racing heart, the adrenaline surge - in response to a stimulus, such as a bear appearing in the kitchen. Then followed the conscious experience of emotion, as the mind processed and assigned meaning to the physiological signals, culminating in a distinct emotional state.",
        "The political turmoil in the kingdom only seemed to deepen as John found himself entangled in a web of alliances and power struggles. With the French king Philip II back from the crusade, John saw an opportunity to expand his territory by forming an alliance with him. He hoped to acquire lands in France that were previously held by Richard in exchange for his support. However, John's mother, seeing the potential risks of such a partnership, advised him against it. Meanwhile, Longchamp, who had left England amid controversy, returned and claimed his rightful position as justiciar. John, keen to maintain his grip on power, quickly quashed Longchamp's claims by securing promises of support from his loyalists within the royal administration. As rumors of Richard's capture spread, John began to assert that his brother was either dead or lost forever, paving the way for him to solidify his claim to the throne. Little did John know that Richard was being held for ransom by the Duke of Austria, giving John the perfect opportunity to seize power and assert his dominance in the kingdom.",
        "Early Modern universities continued the educational traditions of the Middle Ages by offering a curriculum that included natural philosophy, logic, medicine, theology, mathematics, astronomy (including astrology), law, grammar, and rhetoric. The influence of Aristotle, Galen, and Arabic scholarship was pervasive in these academic disciplines. However, the emergence of humanism played a crucial role in reshaping the educational landscape. With the arrival of humanist professors in university faculties, there was a significant shift in the emphasis on grammar and rhetoric through the studia humanitatis. These professors prioritized teaching students how to write and speak eloquently, translate and interpret classical texts, and lead virtuous lives. The humanist approach to learning and linguistic expertise in ancient texts also impacted other scholars within the university, leading to a broader recognition of the importance of classical texts. Even professors of medicine, such as Niccolò Leoniceno, Thomas Linacre, and William Cop, were influenced by humanist ideals in their teaching methods and academic perspectives.",
        "Democratic Party candidates were consistently elected to local office, solidifying the city's connections to the South and its dominant political party. In 1861, Mayor Fernando Wood controversially called on the aldermen to declare independence from Albany and the United States following the secession of the South, a move that ultimately went unheeded. Tensions escalated during the American Civil War (1861–1865) with the introduction of new military conscription laws, which allowed wealthier men to avoid service by paying a $300 commutation fee to hire a substitute. This unfair system sparked outrage among the working class, particularly the ethnic Irish population, leading to the violent Draft Riots of 1863. The riots quickly spiraled out of control, resulting in attacks on New York's elite, followed by targeted violence against black New Yorkers and their property. The underlying competition for jobs between Irish immigrants and black residents had been festering for years, and the riots served as a brutal manifestation of this economic rivalry. The destruction of the Colored Orphan Asylum during the riots was a particularly heinous act, although thankfully more than 200 children were able to escape unharmed thanks to the heroic efforts of some individuals.",
        "The term \"humanism\" took on a new ideological meaning during the mid-18th century, amidst the intellectual fervor of the French Enlightenment. In 1765, an author writing in a French Enlightenment periodical introduced the concept of \"The general love of humanity\", a virtue previously unnamed but deserving of recognition. This author boldly proclaimed the need for a term to encapsulate this beautiful and essential quality, coining the word \"humanism\". The later part of the 18th century and the early 19th century witnessed the emergence of various grassroots organizations and societies devoted to philanthropy and the advancement of human welfare through the dissemination of knowledge, with some being rooted in Christian principles and others not. Following the tumultuous events of the French Revolution, the notion that human virtue could be cultivated solely through human reason, independent of established religious institutions, gained traction. This belief, often attributed to Enlightenment thinkers like Rousseau, sparked heated debates and controversy among those who opposed the revolutionary changes taking place.",
        "The result of John's financial measures was a series of innovative but unpopular initiatives. Unlike his predecessors, John imposed scutage payments a total of eleven times during his seventeen-year reign, surpassing the combined total of the three monarchs before him. These payments were often enforced even in times of peace, contradicting the original purpose of scutage as an alternative to military service. John took advantage of his ability to demand relief payments upon the inheritance of estates and castles, sometimes setting exorbitant fees that exceeded the barons' financial capabilities. Following the successful sale of sheriff appointments in 1194, John introduced a new wave of appointments, allowing the appointees to recoup their investment through increased fines and penalties, particularly in the forests. Expanding on a policy implemented by Richard, John imposed higher charges on widows who chose to remain single. Additionally, John continued the practice of selling charters for the establishment of new towns, further adding to his revenue stream.",
        "The Enlightenment era brought about a shift in religious thought, with the emergence of new ideas such as Deism and discussions about atheism. Deism, as described by Thomas Paine, centered around the belief in a Creator God without relying on religious texts or miracles. Instead, Deists based their beliefs on personal reason, a concept that resonated with many intellectuals of the time. While atheism was a topic of much debate, there were few who openly embraced it. Wilson and Reill point out that very few enlightened thinkers, even those critical of Christianity, identified as true atheists. Instead, they tended towards skepticism, deism, vitalism, or pantheism. Some, like Pierre Bayle, argued for the morality of atheists, while others, such as Voltaire, believed that a belief in a punishing God was necessary for maintaining social order. The fear was that without a higher authority to enforce moral standards, society would descend into chaos. This debate underscores the complexity of religious thought during the Enlightenment, with varying perspectives on the role of religion and morality in society.",
        "Sleep is a crucial component in the process of memory consolidation, as it allows the brain to strengthen neural connections and enhance memory retention. Numerous studies have demonstrated the positive impact of sleep on memory, showing that memories are actively consolidated during sleep. This consolidation process primarily occurs during slow-wave sleep (SWS), during which memories are reactivated and transferred to long-term storage. The hippocampus plays a key role in this process, replaying the day's events for the neocortex, which then processes and reviews memories before moving them into long-term memory. Without sufficient sleep, these neural connections are weakened, making it harder to learn and retain information effectively. Overall, sleep is essential for optimizing memory consolidation and enhancing cognitive function.",
        "It is a common misconception that memory functions like a simple recording device, capturing events as they occur with pristine accuracy. However, the reality is far more intricate and dynamic. The intricate molecular mechanisms that underlie the formation and preservation of memories encompass a series of distinct phases that unfold over a spectrum of time, ranging from mere seconds to an entire lifetime. Intriguingly, studies have shown that memories are not static entities but rather malleable constructs that can be shaped and reshaped during the encoding and retrieval processes. This phenomenon is exemplified in a seminal study by Elizabeth Loftus and John Palmer in 1974, where participants viewed a footage of a traffic accident and were subsequently asked questions about the event. Remarkably, the wording of the questions significantly influenced the participants' recollections, with those asked about cars \"smashing\" into each other providing higher speed estimates than those asked about cars \"hitting\" each other. Moreover, when questioned a week later about the presence of broken glass in the scene, participants primed with the term \"smashed\" were twice as likely to falsely recall seeing shattered glass. This intriguing interplay between language and memory underscores the intricate and often fallible nature of human recollection.",
        "The region of modern Zhejiang existed on the periphery of the Shang civilization's influence during the second millennium BC, with the Hundred Yue tribes, such as the Dongyue and Ouyue, inhabiting the area. The emergence of the kingdom of Yue is noted in historical records from the Spring and Autumn Period, with accounts placing it in northern Zhejiang. Legend has it that the rulers of Yue traced their lineage back to the esteemed Shang figure, Yu the Great. The Baiyue people and the kingdom of Yue had their own distinct cultural practices and historical narratives, setting them apart from the kingdoms of northern and central China. While the cultures and histories of the latter were meticulously documented in chronicles and historical texts during the Spring and Autumn Period and the Qin dynasty, the Baiyue and Yue regions maintained their own unique traditions. One notable example of this cultural distinction is found in the Song of the Yue Boatman (Chinese: 越人歌, p Yuèrén Gē), a poetic composition that reflects the spirit and identity of the Yue people.",
        "Protestantism, originating in the German lands, spread into France where followers were known as Huguenots. Calvin, based in Geneva, maintained a keen interest in French religious affairs and trained pastors to lead congregations there. Despite facing severe persecution, the Reformed tradition gained ground in various parts of the nation, attracting those disillusioned by the rigidity and complacency of the Catholic Church. French Protestantism took on a political dimension, especially evident with the conversion of nobles in the 1550s. This laid the groundwork for the French Wars of Religion, a series of conflicts that escalated following the sudden death of Henry II in 1559. The era was marked by atrocities and brutality, culminating in the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre in August 1572, where the Roman Catholic faction massacred tens of thousands of Huguenots across France.",
        "The National Football League preseason is known for its structured format compared to other team sports. Each NFL team participates in exactly four pre-season exhibition games annually, evenly split between home and away games. The Pro Football Hall of Fame Game adds an extra match for two teams each year. These exhibition games, typically held in August, serve the purpose of aiding coaches in finalizing their roster from the offseason limit of 90 players to the regular-season limit of 53 players. Although the scheduling of preseason games is more flexible compared to regular-season games, there are specific guidelines and customs in place that dictate potential opponents, as well as the days and times that games can be played. Additionally, split-squad games, a common practice in baseball and hockey, allow teams scheduled for two games in one day to divide their roster into two squads for separate matches.",
        "The economic troubles faced by Libya in the early and mid-1980s were severe, with annual oil revenues plummeting from $21 billion to $5.4 billion between 1982 and 1986. Despite this financial crisis, Muammar Gaddafi, the leader of Libya at the time, decided to focus on ambitious projects such as the Great Man-Made River, which aimed to provide irrigation to the arid regions of the country. However, the project faced numerous delays and setbacks, remaining incomplete well into the 21st century. Despite the economic downturn, military spending continued to increase, while other essential administrative budgets were slashed. Additionally, Libya's intervention in the civil war in Chad, supporting the FROLINAT militia, further strained the country's resources and reputation on the international stage. The conflict with French forces, who backed the southern Chadian forces, highlighted Libya's aggressive foreign policy and willingness to intervene in regional conflicts to further its own interests.",
        "South Korea: The event held in Seoul on April 27 was significant not only for its historical connection to the 1988 Summer Olympics but also for the protests and clashes that occurred during the torch relay. The planned torchbearers Choi Seung-kook and Park Won-sun's decision to boycott the event to protest against the Chinese government's actions in Tibet added a political dimension to the proceedings. The deployment of over 8,000 riot police along the 24-kilometre route, starting at Olympic Park, highlighted the tense atmosphere surrounding the event. The clashes between Chinese students and protesters, resulting in the throwing of rocks, bottles, and punches, underscored the deep-rooted conflicts and tensions at play. The attempted self-immolation of a North Korean defector in protest of China's treatment of North Korean refugees further highlighted the complex geopolitical issues surrounding the event. Despite the efforts of the police to control the situation, the confrontations that occurred during the relay demonstrated the diverse range of perspectives and grievances that were present on that day.",
        "The debate surrounding Thomas Jefferson and James Madison's views on the separation of church and state has been a topic of discussion for centuries. Jefferson's refusal to issue Thanksgiving proclamations during his presidency, while Madison issued several religious proclamations but also vetoed bills that went against the first amendment, showcases their differing approaches. Despite their actions, both men attended religious services at the Capitol, showing a complex relationship between religion and government. Madison's belief in the total separation of church and state is evident in his writings, where he emphasized the importance of keeping religion exempt from governmental authority. His strong stance on this issue is reflected in his assertion that the Constitution of the United States is meant to guard the separation between religion and government. The practical distinction between religion and civil government, as articulated by Madison, highlights the complexities of balancing religious freedom and governmental authority.",
        "The impact of Virgil's works on Latin poetry was profound and immediate upon their publication. The Eclogues, Georgics, and especially the Aeneid quickly became essential texts in the educational curriculum, known to all cultured Romans. Subsequent poets frequently drew on Virgil's works for inspiration, creating intertextual references to generate meaning in their own compositions. For example, the Augustan poet Ovid parodied the opening lines of the Aeneid in his Amores, and his condensed retelling of the Aeneas story in the Metamorphoses has been hailed as a significant response to the epic genre post-Virgil. In contrast, Lucan's Bellum Civile has been regarded as an anti-Virgilian epic, eschewing divine intervention, focusing on historical events, and straying from traditional Virgilian epic conventions. Similarly, Statius's epic Thebaid, consisting of 12 books, closely engages with Virgil's poetry, with the poet himself advising his work not to rival the Aeneid but to honor it from a distance. Silius Italicus also pays homage to Virgil's legacy in his own works, showcasing the enduring influence of Virgil on subsequent generations of Roman poets.",
        "Terry Eastland, in her book From Ending Affirmative Action: The Case for Colorblind Justice, delves deep into the controversial topic of affirmative action. She argues that the original intentions behind affirmative action, such as remedying past discrimination and promoting diversity, have been overshadowed by unintended consequences. Eastland believes that the current system of affirmative action has led to a situation where the benefits are often enjoyed by middle-class minorities who may not necessarily need it. She also highlights the negative psychological effects of affirmative action, such as feelings of self-doubt and entitlement among minorities. Eastland strongly believes that affirmative action poses a significant risk, with uncertain rewards. On the other hand, libertarian economist Thomas Sowell, in his book Affirmative Action Around the World: An Empirical Study, presents a critical analysis of affirmative action policies. Sowell argues that these policies can incentivize individuals to falsely identify themselves as members of preferred groups to reap the benefits of affirmative action. This, in turn, may undermine the credibility and fairness of the entire system. Ultimately, both Eastland and Sowell raise important questions about the effectiveness and consequences of affirmative action policies.",
        "Through the fog of war and the cries of battle, the United States found itself entangled in the tumultuous conflict of the War of 1812. Across the vast expanse of the Atlantic, Britain and France clashed in a struggle for supremacy, drawing the United States into their web of conflict. The British, in their relentless pursuit to cripple French trade, began to seize American ships and press their sailors into service aboard Royal Navy vessels. In the heartland of America, indigenous peoples rose up in rebellion, incited by British promises of an Indian state to halt American expansion. Faced with these provocations, the United States could no longer remain on the sidelines of this global conflict. In a bold move, America declared war on the mighty British Empire, a daring act that marked the first official declaration of war in the nation's history. Despite the overwhelming might of the Royal Navy, the U.S. launched an audacious invasion of British Canada, hoping to gain leverage in negotiations. The campaign in Canada proved disastrous, but victories against Native American foes on the western front provided some solace. As the tides of battle ebbed and flowed, the United States stood firm against the storm of war, facing a formidable foe with unyielding resolve.",
        "During the Qing dynasty, the imperial control over the outer regions was upheld by the emperor who fulfilled roles as the Mongol khan, supporter of Tibetan Buddhism, and guardian of Muslims. However, a shift in Qing policy occurred with the establishment of Xinjiang province in 1884. This change was catalyzed by the events of The Great Game era when Yaqub Beg, supported by the British Empire, seized control of Xinjiang during the Dungan revolt in northwest China. The Qing court responded by sending forces to defeat Yaqub Beg, leading to the reconquest of Xinjiang. Subsequently, the political structure of China proper was implemented in Xinjiang. Despite this, the Kumul Khanate, an ally that aided the Qing in vanquishing the Zunghars in 1757, retained its status as a vassal state within the Qing empire until the Xinhai Revolution in 1930. In the early 20th century, British intervention in Tibet further complicated the geopolitical landscape, demonstrating the intricate power dynamics at play in the region.",
        "BYU, short for Brigham Young University, boasts a total of 21 NCAA varsity teams across various sports. The majority of these teams, nineteen to be exact, were active participants in the Mountain West Conference from its establishment in 1999 until the university's departure from the conference in 2011. Prior to joining the Mountain West Conference, BYU's athletic teams competed in the Western Athletic Conference. Known collectively as the \"Cougars\", the teams proudly represent the university, with Cosmo the Cougar serving as the official mascot since 1953. The Cougar Fight Song is the spirited anthem that resonates through the stadium during games. One distinguishing factor of BYU athletes is their age, as many players choose to embark on full-time missions for two years. Male students typically serve their missions at the age of 18, while female students do so at 19. Despite concerns raised about the impact of these missions on athletic eligibility, the NCAA permits students to fulfill their religious obligations without affecting their eligibility period. Critics have debated whether this policy gives BYU an unfair advantage, but it is widely acknowledged that the absence of athletic and physical training during missions negates any potential benefits. Additionally, BYU's stance on scheduling games has garnered attention from sports networks, as the university has declined to participate in events that conflict with its religious beliefs.",
        "John's response to the interdict imposed by Pope Innocent was one of defiance and aggression. Viewing the interdict as a direct challenge to his authority, John sought to undermine Innocent's influence by targeting individual clergy who showed support for the papal directives. He confiscated the lands of clergy who refused to conduct services and those affiliated with Innocent, as well as arresting the concubines of many clerics and demanding fines for their release. Additionally, John seized the lands of church members who had fled the country and offered protection to clergy who remained loyal to him. Despite some negotiations allowing certain institutions to manage their properties, the conflict remained unresolved by 1209. Facing excommunication, John remained obstinate in his refusal to accept the appointment of Stephen Langton as Archbishop of Canterbury. Innocent's threats failed to sway John, leading to a prolonged and contentious standoff between the English monarch and the papacy.",
        "In mainland China, the Japanese 3rd, 6th, and 40th Divisions gathered at Yueyang and organized their forces to advance southward in three separate columns. They successfully crossed the Xinqiang River and attempted to push further by crossing the Miluo River in order to reach Changsha. However, in January of 1942, Chinese forces achieved a significant victory at Changsha, marking the first successful Allied resistance against the Japanese in the region. Following the Doolittle Raid, the Japanese army launched a large-scale operation known as the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Campaign, targeting Zhejiang and Jiangxi provinces in China. The main objectives of this campaign were to locate and capture any surviving American airmen, punish the Chinese individuals who had assisted them, and dismantle any remaining air bases in the area. This operation commenced on May 15, 1942, with the deployment of 40 infantry battalions and 15-16 artillery battalions. Despite the initial strength of the Japanese forces, the campaign was ultimately thwarted by the resilient Chinese defenders in September of the same year. The Imperial Japanese Army's presence during this campaign left a path of destruction and suffering in its wake, causing widespread devastation throughout the region.",
        "CNET's review of the new Super Slim PlayStation 3 gave it a solid 4 out of 5 stars, praising its powerful gaming capabilities and impressive array of streaming services. However, the review also pointed out some drawbacks, such as the \"cheap\" design and disc-loader. The reviewer noted that the disc cover sometimes fails to catch properly, giving the impression of using an outdated credit card imprinter machine. This design flaw was seen as a step back from the convenience of autoloading disc trays. Additionally, the reviewer criticized the pricing of the Super Slim model, noting that it was still more expensive than the Slim model despite the smaller size and larger hard drive. The review argued that the bigger hard drive shouldn't be considered an upgrade when the Slim model's hard drive is easily replaceable. Overall, while the Super Slim PlayStation 3 offers a compact design and powerful performance, it falls short in terms of design quality and pricing.",
        "Dorgon's controversial July 1645 edict, also known as the \"haircutting order,\" sent shockwaves through the Han Chinese population. The mandate dictated that adult Han Chinese men must shave the front of their heads and adopt the queue hairstyle worn by Manchu men, under penalty of death. The order represented a stark divide between the two cultures, with the Manchus viewing it as a test of loyalty and a way to easily distinguish between friend and foe. However, for the Han Chinese, it was a painful reminder of Qing authority that directly challenged their deeply held Confucian beliefs. The Classic of Filial Piety (Xiaojing) emphasized the sacredness of one's body and hair as gifts from one's parents, making the act of cutting their hair a deeply humiliating and disrespectful gesture. Under the previous Ming dynasty, adult men had proudly worn their hair long, reflecting traditional Confucian values of filial piety and respect for one's ancestors. The imposition of the queue hairstyle not only symbolized the dominance of the Qing dynasty but also served as a constant reminder of the Han Chinese subjugation under Manchu rule.",
        "Boundaries dance between inclusivity and exclusivity, shaping the way we connect with one another. A marker, wielded with intention, can either invite or repel, creating a barrier that defines our relationships. A boundary becomes exclusive when it sets limits on the actions and behaviors of others, drawing a line in the sand that separates us. Conversely, an inclusive boundary is built on a foundation of mutual understanding and acceptance, a bridge that brings us together. Yet even within this inclusivity, there lies a subtle restriction - a line that marks the limits of our belonging. Take, for instance, the newcomer in a room of diverse tongues, speaking a language unknown to some and familiar to others. To some, this foreign tongue may be a mere symbol of identity, a neutral sign of difference. But to others, it may feel like a wall, dividing them from the speaker. In this delicate dance of boundaries, we navigate the spaces between us, seeking connection amidst the barriers that separate us.",
        "The introduction of flexible or \"unbreakable\" records made of unconventional materials during the 78 rpm era was met with mixed results by manufacturers. In the UK, Nicole records, composed of celluloid or a similar substance coated onto a cardboard core disc, were introduced in 1904 but faced criticism due to their excessively high surface noise. Meanwhile, in the United States, Columbia Records attempted to revolutionize the industry with their fiber-cored \"Marconi Velvet Tone Record\" pressings in 1907. However, the success of these records hinged on the use of specific gold-plated Marconi Needles, ultimately leading to their lackluster performance in the market. Similarly, thin, flexible plastic records like the German Phonycord and British Filmophone and Goodson records emerged around 1930 but failed to gain traction. The French Pathé Cellodiscs, made of a thin black plastic, were also short-lived and did not leave a lasting impact on the industry. Overall, the introduction of these unconventional materials for record production showcased the industry's experimentation but ultimately fell short of providing a viable alternative to traditional records.",
        "The decision to return Strasbourg to France following the Treaty of Versailles in 1919 was made without a referendum, in line with Woodrow Wilson's \"Fourteen Points.\" The assignment of the city to France was backdated to Armistice Day, raising questions about the legitimacy of the decision. It is questionable whether a referendum in Strasbourg would have favored France, as political parties advocating for an autonomous Alsace or a connection to France held only a small share of the votes in the Reichstag and local elections. Pro-French Alsatian autonomists, who had gained support in rural areas and other towns since the region's annexation by Germany in 1871, saw some success in the movement for autonomy. The Alsatians elected to the German Reichstag, known as \"les députés protestataires,\" were the only representatives from the region until Bismarck's fall in 1890.",
        "In the midst of the changing landscape of Western Europe, the Eastern Roman Empire stood as a beacon of stability and prosperity. While new kingdoms were forming in the west, the eastern section of the empire experienced a period of economic revival that stretched into the early 7th century. The Balkans saw the most frequent invasions, but overall, the Eastern Empire enjoyed a relative peace, even maintaining friendly relations with its long-standing rival, Persia. This period also saw a deepening of ties between the political state and the Christian Church in the east, with religious matters playing a significant role in politics. Legal advancements were also made, with the codification of Roman law through the Theodosian Code in 438 and the Corpus Juris Civilis under Emperor Justinian's rule. Justinian's reign was marked by notable achievements, including the construction of the magnificent Hagia Sophia in Constantinople and successful military campaigns that saw the reconquest of North Africa and Italy. However, his plans for further conquest were halted by a devastating plague outbreak in 542, forcing him to focus on defensive actions for the remainder of his reign.",
        "When Nintendo introduced the NES to the American market, they made a conscious decision to set it apart from other gaming consoles through unique design elements. This strategy was implemented in order to distance the NES from the negative connotations associated with gaming systems following the video game crash of 1983. To achieve this, Nintendo incorporated a front-loading zero insertion force (ZIF) cartridge socket, cleverly disguised to resemble the familiar front-loading mechanism of a VCR. The innovative connector mechanism worked effectively when both the connectors and cartridges were in pristine condition. However, the ZIF connector was not entirely \"zero insertion force,\" as the act of pressing the cartridge down into place caused the contact pins to slightly bend and the cartridge's ROM board to be pushed back. Over time, the repeated insertion and removal of cartridges led to wear and tear on the pins, ultimately impacting the functionality of the ZIF connector. Thus, while the design of the NES was innovative and visually appealing, it also had its drawbacks in terms of long-term durability.",
        "Protestants were at the forefront of the fight for religious freedom, with the concept of freedom of conscience becoming a central focus of theological, philosophical, and political discussions. This emphasis can be traced back to Martin Luther's bold stand at the Diet of Worms in 1521, where he refused to renounce his beliefs, asserting that faith was a personal matter guided by the Holy Spirit and could not be imposed by force. The persecuted Anabaptists and Huguenots also championed the cause of freedom of conscience, advocating for the separation of church and state. Building on this foundation, Baptist leaders like John Smyth and Thomas Helwys penned influential tracts in defense of religious liberty in the early 17th century. Their ideas resonated with thinkers such as John Milton and John Locke, who embraced a more tolerant approach. In the American colonies, leaders like Roger Williams, Thomas Hooker, and William Penn established democratic societies in Rhode Island, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania that guaranteed freedom of religion. These colonies provided sanctuary for religious minorities, including Jews, and laid the groundwork for the principles enshrined in the United States Declaration of Independence, Constitution, and Bill of Rights.",
        "Birds have evolved a highly efficient respiratory system that far surpasses that of mammals. With a surface area to gas exchange volume ratio that is ten times greater than that of mammals, birds are able to effectively diffuse oxygen into their blood. This is due to the fact that birds have a higher concentration of blood in their capillaries per unit volume of lung compared to mammals. The arteries in birds are constructed with thick elastic muscles to withstand the pressure of ventricular constriction and become increasingly rigid as they move away from the heart. Blood is then transported through the arteries, undergoing vasoconstriction, and into arterioles which serve as a distribution system for oxygen and nutrients to all tissues in the body. As the arterioles branch out into individual organs and tissues, they further divide to increase surface area and slow down blood flow. Within the capillaries, which are organized into capillary beds in tissues, gas exchange takes place, allowing for the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide. This intricate system in birds highlights their superior adaptation for efficient oxygen diffusion and distribution throughout the body.",
        "The men's basketball team at the university boasts an impressive history, with over 1,600 wins to their name. This places them among an elite group of schools who have achieved such a milestone, with only 12 others reaching that mark. They have also made their mark in the NCAA tournaments, appearing in 28 tournaments throughout their history. One of the most memorable moments in the team's history was when former player Austin Carr set a record for the most points scored in a single game of the tournament with an incredible 61 points. Despite never clinching an NCAA Tournament victory, the team was honored as national champions twice by the Helms Athletic Foundation. Their legacy is also marked by their ability to pull off upsets, with notable victories including ending UCLA's record 88-game winning streak in 1974. The team has defeated an additional eight number-one ranked teams, solidifying their reputation as a formidable opponent. Their home games are now played in the newly renovated Purcell Pavilion, located within the Edmund P. Joyce Center, which reopened at the start of the 2009–2010 season. Leading the team is coach Mike Brey, who has been at the helm since the 2014–15 season, guiding the team to continued success on and off the court.",
        "One hundred years after the fall of Constantinople in 1453, Pierre Belon's observations in 1553 shed light on the use of pissasphalto, a concoction of pitch and bitumen, in the naval industry of Dubrovnik. This substance was utilized for the tarring of ships before being transported to the bustling marketplaces of Venice, where it found eager buyers. Interestingly, an 1838 edition of Mechanics Magazine documented an early instance of asphalt being employed in France, hinting at a broader historical significance of this versatile material. A pamphlet dating back to 1621, penned by a certain Monsieur d'Eyrinys, revealed the discovery of abundant deposits of asphaltum near Neufchatel. In a visionary move, Monsieur d'Eyrinys proposed utilizing this resource for various purposes, including the construction of airtight granaries and the safeguarding of watercourses in Paris with the help of protective arches, aiming to shield them from contamination and debris. Such instances underscore the enduring appeal and utility of asphalt throughout history.",
        "Established in 1852, Marshall Field & Company quickly became a beloved institution on State Street in Chicago, drawing in upscale shoppers from all around the Midwest. Its reputation for exceptional customer service set it apart from other department stores, and it was known for its luxurious accommodations and elegant atmosphere. As the chain expanded, it continued to innovate, introducing concepts like the European buying office in England and the bridal registry, which were the first of their kind in the industry. The introduction of the personal shopper service, offered at no extra cost, further solidified Marshall Field's reputation as a trendsetter in the retail world. The iconic Frango mints brand, originally from Frederick & Nelson Department store, also became synonymous with Marshall Field's and Chicago. The conversion to Macy's in 2006 marked the end of an era, but Marshall Field's legacy of excellence and innovation lives on in the memories of its loyal customers.",
        "Some street trams, also known as streetcars, utilized a unique method of current collection known as conduit third-rail technology. This system involved a third rail located below street level, with the tram accessing the current through a plough, also known as a plow, that could be lowered into a narrow slot in the road. In the United States, this method was used in certain cities such as Washington, D.C. and Manhattan to avoid the visual clutter of overhead wires and poles typically associated with electric traction systems. Even today, remnants of this technology can still be observed on the tracks leading down the slope at the abandoned Kingsway Tramway Subway in central London, where the slot between the running rails is clearly visible. Similarly, evidence of this mode of operation can be seen on P and Q Streets west of Wisconsin Avenue in the historic Georgetown neighborhood. This unique approach to current collection added to the charm and character of these streetcar systems, offering a glimpse into the innovative transportation methods of the past.",
        "The significant growth of the Asian American population in New York City, particularly the Chinese community, has had a profound impact on the cultural landscape of the city. With over one million Asian Americans residing in the city, New York boasts the largest Asian population of any U.S. city proper. Queens, in particular, stands out as a hub for Asian American communities, hosting the state's largest population and serving as a melting pot for diverse ethnic backgrounds. The rapid expansion of Chinese enclaves beyond Manhattan's Chinatown into neighborhoods like Brooklyn and Flushing reflects the changing demographics and migration patterns of new immigrants. While the growth of these communities may signify cultural richness, it also raises questions about gentrification, displacement, and the challenges of assimilation faced by new arrivals. As Chinese immigration continues to shape the fabric of New York City and its surrounding areas, it is crucial to critically examine the impact of this demographic shift on social, economic, and political dynamics within the city.",
        "Jeffrey Long and Rick Kittles' 2003 paper, \"Human Genetic Diversity and the Nonexistence of Biological Races,\" provides a comprehensive critique of the application of FST to human populations. They argue that the commonly cited figure of 85% genetic diversity among human populations is misleading as it suggests that all populations share a significant portion of genetic material. Long and Kittles contend that this oversimplification fails to account for the intricate relationships between human groups throughout history. They propose a more nuanced approach that considers the hierarchical nature of human population structure, with some groups serving as ancestors to others. For instance, according to the recent African origin theory, African populations are ancestral to all non-African populations, making them paraphyletic groups in relation to their descendants. By recognizing these complex interconnections, Long and Kittles challenge the notion of discrete biological races and advocate for a more accurate understanding of human genetic diversity.",
        "Libya's economy experienced a significant shift towards privatization during the early 2000s, diverging from the socialist principles outlined in The Green Book. Despite disavowing capitalist ideals, government officials argued that they were advancing a form of \"people's socialism\" through these reforms. Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi endorsed the privatization initiatives and advocated for widespread privatization in a speech delivered in March 2003. By 2003, the oil industry had been largely transferred to private entities, leading to a substantial increase in direct foreign investment in the country, which reached $40 billion by 2004, marking a sixfold rise from the previous year. The implementation of these economic changes faced resistance from various segments of the population, resulting in public demonstrations. In March 2006, hard-line revolutionaries assumed control of the General People's Committee cabinet, adjusting the pace of reforms while continuing with the privatization process. Plans were unveiled in 2010 to privatize half of Libya's economy within the subsequent decade, although political liberalization did not accompany these economic shifts, as Gaddafi maintained a dominant grip on power. Nevertheless, in March 2010, the government decentralization process was expanded, granting additional authority to municipal councils. This period also saw a surge in efforts to modernize and diversify the Libyan economy, reflecting a broader trend towards economic liberalization in the region.",
        "The initial military maneuvers of September 1806 marked the beginning of a significant campaign led by Napoleon. In a detailed letter to Marshal Soult, Napoleon outlined the strategic plan for the upcoming battles and introduced the concept of le bataillon-carré, or the square battalion. This innovative system emphasized the importance of unity and coordination among the various corps of the Grande Armée, enabling them to march together in close proximity and provide mutual support in the event of an attack. With a formidable force of 180,000 troops, Napoleon swiftly invaded Prussia, advancing along the right bank of the River Saale. His overarching goal remained consistent with previous campaigns - to swiftly defeat one opponent before reinforcements from another could alter the course of the war. Upon locating the Prussian army, the French forces swiftly changed direction and crossed the Saale with overwhelming strength. The decisive battles of Jena and Auerstedt, fought on 14 October, resulted in resounding victories for the French forces, solidifying Napoleon's dominance on the battlefield.",
        "Regarding the timing of German rapprochement, many historians argue that the removal of Maxim Litvinov, a Jewish diplomat, played a crucial role in opening up negotiations with Nazi Germany. Stalin's swift decision to purge the ministry of Jews after Litvinov's dismissal sent a clear message that the Soviet Union was willing to explore a different approach in its foreign relations. Litvinov, known for his efforts to build an anti-fascist coalition and his alignment with Western powers, was seen as an obstacle to potential talks with Germany. His replacement by Molotov, a more hardline and ideologically driven figure, signaled to both Germany and the Western powers that the Soviet Union was ready to consider new alliances. This shift in leadership not only altered the diplomatic landscape but also raised questions about the direction of Soviet foreign policy. The loss of Litvinov, described by some as a skilled diplomat and mediator, was seen as a setback for those hoping for a more moderate approach from the Soviet Union. Molotov's appointment, with his more rigid and uncompromising stance, indicated a shift towards a more aggressive and assertive foreign policy strategy. Overall, the dismissal of Litvinov and the rise of Molotov marked a significant turning point in Soviet diplomacy and set the stage for a new era of geopolitical maneuvering.",
        "Critics painted a bleak picture of Gaddafi, portraying him as a tyrannical and oppressive leader who ruled with an iron fist. Western governments and media outlets vilified him as a ruthless dictator who oppressed his own people. The Reagan administration in the United States went so far as to label him as \"Public Enemy No. 1\" and compared him to a \"mad dog\" in the volatile region of the Middle East. The pervasive surveillance of civilians by Gaddafi's government instilled a sense of fear among the Libyan population, leading to the characterization of Libya as a police state. Human rights organizations such as Human Rights Watch documented numerous instances of human rights abuses, including the lack of fair trials for political opponents, cases of torture, and extrajudicial executions, most notably in the notorious Abu Salim prison. The alleged massacre on 29 June 1996, in which hundreds were reportedly killed, highlighted the brutal tactics employed by Gaddafi's regime to maintain control.",
        "A true predator is defined as an organism that kills and consumes another living organism for sustenance. Unlike other forms of predation that may cause harm to their prey without necessarily killing them, predators of this nature actively seek out and ultimately kill their prey. Predators exhibit various hunting strategies, such as pursuit predation where they actively chase down their prey, or ambush predation where they lie in wait for their prey to come within striking distance. The manner in which predators consume their prey also varies; some predators, like jaguars or humans, kill and dismember their large prey before consuming it, while others, like bottlenose dolphins or snakes, may consume their prey whole. The feeding behavior of predators can also depend on the size of the prey and the circumstances, as seen in domestic cats and dogs that may either consume a small prey whole or dismember a larger prey before consuming it. Additionally, some predators use venom to subdue their prey before consuming it, ensuring a swift and efficient kill.",
        "Great upheavals in the ancient history of the Israelites led to periods of both political independence and subjugation. The Israelites experienced two distinct eras of autonomy, first during the time of the Biblical judges and then under the United Monarchy. However, the unity of the Israelites was short-lived as the kingdom eventually split into Israel and Judah. The term \"Jew\" originated from the Roman designation \"Judean,\" referring to those from the southern kingdom of Judah. This transition from \"Israelites\" to \"Jews\" is not explicitly mentioned in the Torah but is evident in the Book of Esther, a text from the Ketuvim section of the Jewish Tanakh. The capture of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar II in 587 BC marked a turning point for the Israelites, leading to the destruction of the First Temple and the deportation of many prominent citizens of Judah. The fall of Judah in 586 BC extinguished its status as an independent kingdom, leaving the remaining Jews without a state. The Babylonian exile came to an end in 539 BCE when the Achaemenid Empire overthrew Babylon, with King Cyrus allowing the exiled Jews to return to their homeland.",
        "Van Praag's assertion regarding the Ming court's establishment of diplomatic delegations with Tibet solely for the acquisition of horses is contested by Wang and Nyima, who argue that these delegations were not diplomatic in nature. They posit that the Ming exerted control over Tibetan territories by appointing Tibetan leaders as Ming officials, thereby integrating Tibetan areas into the Ming administration. Furthermore, they suggest that the collection of horses from Tibet was not a diplomatic exchange but rather a compulsory \"corvée\" tax imposed on the Tibetan population. Sperling adds to this discourse by highlighting the Ming's simultaneous procurement of horses from the Kham region, their conflicts with Tibetan tribes in Amdo, and the reception of Tibetan embassies in Nanjing. He posits that the visits of Tibetan lamas to the Ming court were primarily aimed at fostering commercial transactions between the lamas' affluent entourage and Ming merchants and officials. Kolmaš contributes to this discussion by noting the Ming's hands-off approach towards Tibet and their restrictions on the number of Tibetan envoys allowed, while emphasizing the Tibetans' efforts to maintain a tributary relationship with the Ming as a means of securing imperial favor.",
        "The deaths of the Guangxu Emperor and Cixi in November 1908 marked a significant turning point in Chinese history. Speculation arose regarding the circumstances of the Guangxu Emperor's death, with rumors suggesting foul play involving poison. Decades later, an autopsy revealed traces of arsenic in his body, supporting these suspicions. With the Guangxu Emperor's passing, Puyi, the young son of Zaifeng, Prince Chun, was named as his successor at the tender age of two, under the regency of his father. This transition of power also saw the removal of General Yuan Shikai from his influential positions. In an effort to stabilize the government, Zaifeng established a new cabinet with two vice-premiers in April 1911. However, this cabinet, known as \"The Royal Cabinet\" at the time, continued to face challenges and scrutiny from contemporaries.",
        "Plumage plays a crucial role in the life cycle of birds, as it is regularly moulted to ensure the health and vitality of the bird. After breeding, birds typically transition to their \"non-breeding\" plumage, also known as \"basic\" plumage in the Humphrey-Parkes system. Breeding plumages or variations of the basic plumage are referred to as \"alternate\" plumages. While moulting is an annual process for most bird species, some may undergo two moults a year, while larger birds of prey may only moult once every few years. The moulting patterns can vary significantly across species. In passerines, for example, flight feathers are replaced one at a time, with the innermost primary feather being the first to be replaced. The moulting process then progresses outward, with the outermost tertiaries being the last to drop. Additionally, the greater primary coverts are typically moulted in synchrony with the primary feathers they overlap. This moulting process, known as centrifugal moult, is just one of the many variations seen in birds across different species.",
        "The emergence of agrarian societies in southeast Europe can be traced back to the 7th millennium BC, with evidence found at the farming site in Vashtëmi, southeastern Albania, dating back to 6,500 BC. The discovery of anthropomorphic figurines in the Balkans from 6000 BC and in Central Europe around 5800 BC (La Hoguette) further indicates the early presence of settled agricultural communities in the region. The Sesklo culture in Thessaly is considered one of the earliest cultural complexes in the area, later influencing the development of the Starčevo-Körös (Cris), Linearbandkeramik, and Vinča cultures in the Balkans. As a result of cultural diffusion and population movements, Neolithic traditions gradually spread westward and northward, reaching northwestern Europe by approximately 4500 BC. The Vinča culture, known for its advanced pottery and metallurgy, is also believed to have potentially developed the earliest form of writing, known as the Vinča signs. However, some archaeologists, such as Shan Winn, argue that these symbols likely represented pictograms and ideograms rather than a fully developed writing system.",
        "Since the end of the Vietnam War, Yale's representation in national elections has been a topic of much discussion and analysis. Many attribute this phenomenon to the campus activism that has been a defining feature of Yale since the 1960s. The intellectual influence of Reverend William Sloane Coffin on several future candidates has also been noted as a contributing factor. Yale President Richard Levin has emphasized the university's focus on creating a \"laboratory for future leaders,\" a priority that dates back to the tenures of Yale Presidents Alfred Whitney Griswold and Kingman Brewster. Richard H. Brodhead, former dean of Yale College and current president of Duke University, has highlighted the emphasis on community orientation in Yale's admissions process and the strong tradition of volunteerism at the university. Yale historian Gaddis Smith has pointed to an ethos of organized activity at Yale during the 20th century, which has influenced notable figures such as John Kerry, George Pataki, and Joseph Lieberman in their formative years at Yale. Camille Paglia has also drawn attention to the rich history of the university, which has played a role in shaping the political and social consciousness of its students over the years.",
        "St. John's, among major Canadian cities, holds the titles of being the foggiest, windiest, and cloudiest. With 124 foggy days, an average wind speed of 24.3 km/h (15.1 mph), and a mere 1,497 hours of sunshine, the city's weather patterns distinguish it from its Canadian counterparts. Despite its reputation for fog and wind, St. John's experiences milder temperatures during the winter months compared to other cities in Canada. In fact, it boasts the mildest winter of any Canadian city outside of British Columbia. Precipitation is a constant presence in St. John's, with heavy rainfall occurring throughout the year. Summers tend to be drier, with occasional thunderstorms, while the wettest months are from October to January. December stands out as the wettest month, with an average of nearly 165 millimetres of precipitation. This winter precipitation peak sets St. John's apart from typical humid continental climates, which usually experience their highest rainfall in late spring or early summer.",
        "France: The torch relay leg in Paris, held on April 7, was a highly anticipated event that began on the iconic first level of the Eiffel Tower and concluded at the Stade Charléty. Originally planned to cover a distance of 28 km, the route was unexpectedly shortened due to pressure from Chinese officials in response to the disruptive protests led by pro-Tibet and human rights activists. These activists continuously attempted to disrupt, hinder, or even bring the procession to a complete standstill. As tensions escalated, a planned ceremony at the town hall was abruptly cancelled at the request of the Chinese authorities. Furthermore, the Chinese officials insisted that the torch be transported by bus for the final part of the relay instead of being carried by athletes as initially planned. Despite these obstacles, the Paris City officials had announced their intention to peacefully protest upon the arrival of the Olympic flame in the French capital. In a symbolic gesture, the city government proudly displayed a banner stating \"Paris defends human rights throughout\".",
        "In various surveys conducted across Europe and the United States, green has emerged as the predominant color associated with a myriad of symbolic meanings. It is often linked to notions of nature, life, vitality, youthfulness, the arrival of spring, and the optimism of hope. However, the color green also carries with it more negative connotations in certain cultures, such as associations with death, illness, or even the malevolent presence of the devil. Interestingly, in Chinese culture, green is viewed in an overwhelmingly positive light, symbolizing fertility and joy. During the epochs of the Middle Ages and Renaissance, when one's social standing was often reflected through the colors of their garments, green was typically donned by the prosperous ranks of merchants, bankers, and the affluent gentry. In stark contrast, red was reserved for the noble class. This stark divide is exemplified in Leonardo da Vinci's iconic painting, the Mona Lisa, where the protagonist is depicted clad in green attire, signaling her non-aristocratic lineage. Furthermore, the distinct color-coding is evident in the seating arrangements of the British Parliament, where the benches in the House of Commons are upholstered in green, while those in the House of Lords are adorned in regal red. Beyond its symbolic significance, green also serves as a universal indicator of safety and approval; a green light signifies permission to proceed, while a green card grants the bearer the privilege of permanent residency.",
        "During this era, Libya experienced a significant shift in its international relations. In the late 1990s, discussions began between Libya and the British government to repair their diplomatic ties. By 2001, Muammar Gaddafi publicly denounced the terrorist attacks on September 11th and expressed support for the United States in the War on Terror. Despite this stance against extremism, Gaddafi's regime continued to crack down on domestic Islamist groups while also advocating for the implementation of sharia law. Libya also strengthened its connections with countries like China and North Korea, with Chinese President Jiang Zemin paying a visit in 2002. The aftermath of the Iraq War prompted Libya to abandon its weapons of mass destruction programs in 2003, leading to improved relations with the U.S. and a historic meeting between Gaddafi and UK Prime Minister Tony Blair in 2004. Gaddafi further signaled a desire for closer ties with the European Union by visiting its headquarters in Brussels shortly after.",
        "Constantius, the ruler at the time, made the decision to exile Liberius in the year 356, giving him a mere three days to comply with the order. Liberius was sent to the city of Beroea in Thrace, a place far from the comforts of his previous life. Despite the distance and the harshness of his punishment, Constantius attempted to sway Liberius to his side by offering him expensive gifts if he were to accept the Arian position. However, Liberius remained steadfast in his beliefs and refused the gifts, stating that they would be better suited for those who sought to flatter him. Even when the empress sent a similar gift, Liberius rejected it, urging the messenger to believe in Christ and to stop persecuting the Church of God. Constantius, displeased with Liberius's defiance, summoned him to Milan under strict guard. In a bold move, Liberius confronted Constantius at a conference, defending Athanasius and exposing the falsehoods of his enemies, standing up for what he believed was just.",
        "The release of The College Dropout by Roc-A-Fella in February 2004 marked a turning point in Kanye West's career. The album quickly climbed to number two on the Billboard 200, showcasing West's unique blend of soulful beats and introspective lyrics. His debut single, \"Through the Wire,\" which he recorded while recovering from a near-fatal car accident, captured listeners with its raw emotion and resilience. The success continued with his second single, \"Slow Jamz,\" a collaboration with Twista and Jamie Foxx that topped the charts and solidified West's status as a hitmaker. Critics were quick to praise The College Dropout for its innovative sound and thought-provoking themes, with some even dubbing it the best album of the year. One standout track, \"Jesus Walks,\" tackled the topic of faith head-on, sparking conversations about spirituality and religion in mainstream music.

The College Dropout not only solidified West's place in hip-hop history but also paved the way for a new wave of artists unafraid to speak their truth.",
        "The formation of the Montana Territory on April 26, 1864, marked a significant milestone in the educational development of the region. Even before it was officially recognized as a territory, schools began to take shape as families settled in the area. The earliest schools were subscription schools, often held in the homes of teachers. One of the first formal schools on record was established at Fort Owen in the Bitterroot valley in 1862, catering to Indian children and the offspring of Fort Owen employees. The school term commenced in early winter and concluded by the end of February, with Mr. Robinson serving as the instructor. Another notable subscription school was initiated by Thomas Dimsdale in Virginia City in 1863, where students were charged $1.75 per week for their education. The convening of the Montana Territorial Legislative Assembly in 1864 marked a pivotal moment as the first legislature granted counties the authority to impose taxes for the purpose of funding schools, laying the groundwork for the establishment of public schooling in the region.",
        "Self-esteem plays a crucial role in the formation of one's identity, as it encompasses one's perception of themselves and their worth. It is believed that individuals of all ages and genders have a strong desire to maintain, protect, and enhance their self-esteem. Despite common assumptions, research has shown that there is no significant decrease in self-esteem during adolescence. While fluctuations in self-esteem, referred to as \"barometric self-esteem,\" can occur rapidly and lead to feelings of distress and anxiety, baseline self-esteem remains relatively stable throughout adolescence. Critics have raised concerns about the validity of global self-esteem scales, suggesting that more specific scales may provide a more accurate representation of an adolescent's self-perception. For girls, supportive relationships with friends play a crucial role in fostering high self-esteem. Girls often value friendships that provide social and moral support, highlighting the importance of these relationships in shaping their self-concept and identity.",
        "The deeper ancestral demography of Bermuda's population has been shrouded in mystery due to the ethnic blending that has occurred over the past four centuries. Unlike in the 17th century, when distinct ethnic groups were more prevalent, modern-day Bermuda shows little differentiation between black and white Bermudians, aside from newer immigrant communities. Initially, white Protestants of English descent dominated the population, with smaller numbers of Irish and Scottish settlers also present. Non-white minorities included Spanish-speaking free blacks from the West Indies, black slaves captured by Bermudian privateers from Spanish and Portuguese ships, and Native Americans from various tribes along the Atlantic coast. By the 19th century, the once-dominant white English Bermudians had relinquished their majority status, leading to a more diverse and multicultural population.",
        "In the realm of technological rivalry, Intel and Apple found themselves at odds over the future of the Macintosh platform. Intel, with its CISC architecture, sought to sway Apple towards utilizing their chips, but Apple stood firm in their belief that RISC processors held the key to superior performance. The Motorola 68040, boasting capabilities on par with Intel's 80486, showcased the potential of RISC over CISC. However, Intel's 486 series, with its ability to clock at higher speeds without overheating, proved to be a formidable competitor. Apple's strategic decisions further hindered their position, as they initially limited the use of the '040 to their high-end Quadras, while Intel's 486 was more widely available to OEMs and DIY enthusiasts. As the Macintosh lineup began its transition to the '040 in the early '90s, Apple found themselves facing challenges in maintaining their competitive edge in the rapidly evolving tech landscape.",
        "During the 2000s, several hard rock bands from the 1970s and 1980s managed to sustain successful recording careers. Bon Jovi achieved commercial success with their hit single \"It's My Life\" from the album Crush (2000), which went double platinum. AC/DC released the platinum-certified Stiff Upper Lip (2000), continuing their successful run.

        "To prevent the risk of out-of-phase supplies mixing and ensure the safe operation of the railway system, it is imperative that sections of line fed from different feeder stations remain strictly isolated. This is achieved through the use of Neutral Sections, also referred to as Phase Breaks, which are typically installed at feeder stations and at intervals between them. Although there are usually multiple Neutral Sections along the line, only half of them are in use at any given time. The additional Neutral Sections are provided to facilitate the shutdown of a feeder station, allowing power to be supplied from neighboring feeder stations. Neutral Sections consist of an earthed wire that is separated from the live wires on either side by insulating material, such as ceramic beads. This design ensures that the pantograph can smoothly transition from one section to another without causing any disruptions. By providing an earthed section, the risk of an arc being drawn between live sections is minimized, especially in cases where the voltage difference between the sections is higher than the normal system voltage. This precaution is essential as it ensures that protective circuit breakers can effectively interrupt any excessive current flow, thereby maintaining the system's overall safety and reliability.",
        "Carolingian art, created for a select group of individuals within the court, as well as the monasteries and churches that they patronized, sought to revive the grandeur and elegance of imperial Roman and Byzantine art. However, it also drew inspiration from the vibrant energy of Insular art originating from the British Isles. This fusion of Irish Celtic and Anglo-Saxon Germanic styles with Mediterranean influences, such as the intricate detailing found in illuminated manuscripts and carved ivories, laid the foundation for artistic expression throughout the medieval era. While religious works from the Early Middle Ages primarily survive in the form of these illuminated manuscripts and ivories, many precious metal pieces have been lost to time, as they were often repurposed or melted down. Despite this, a few exceptional treasures such as the Cross of Lothair, reliquaries, and notable archaeological finds like the Sutton Hoo burial and hoards from various regions serve as rare glimpses into the opulence and artistry of the era.",
        "Successful cultivation of cotton requires a combination of specific environmental conditions, including a long frost-free period, ample sunshine, and a moderate amount of rainfall ranging from 600 to 1,200 mm. While soils should ideally be heavy, the nutrient content does not need to be exceptionally high. These conditions are typically found in the seasonally dry tropics and subtropics of both the Northern and Southern hemispheres. However, a significant portion of the world's cotton is grown in regions with lower rainfall, relying on irrigation for water supply. Planting typically begins soon after the previous autumn's harvest, with cotton being grown as an annual crop to manage pest populations. In the Northern hemisphere, planting occurs in the spring, starting as early as February and extending through June. One notable cotton-producing region in the United States is the South Plains.",
        "The book was not only widely translated during Darwin's lifetime, but it also faced challenges when it came to accurately conveying the concepts and metaphors he had carefully crafted. Some translations ended up being influenced by the personal agendas of the translators, which led to biased interpretations. Darwin took the initiative to distribute presentation copies of his work in France and Germany, hoping to attract suitable translators who would work with local publishers. Among the translators was the esteemed naturalist and geologist Heinrich Georg Bronn, whose German translation of the book in 1860 introduced controversial themes that Darwin had intentionally left out. Bronn's interpretation, which included changing \"favoured races\" to \"perfected races\" and adding essays on topics like the origin of life and religious implications, did not align with Darwin's original intentions. Despite the initial setbacks, Darwin collaborated closely with Julius Victor Carus to produce a more accurate and improved translation in 1867. Darwin's determination to ensure his ideas were accurately conveyed in different languages ultimately led to a more faithful representation of his work in foreign markets.",
        "During the Capetian dynasty, France gradually increased its control over the nobility, extending its reach beyond the Île-de-France and spreading its influence across the country in the 11th and 12th centuries. The Dukes of Normandy posed a formidable challenge, particularly when William the Conqueror conquered England in 1066, establishing a powerful cross-channel empire that endured throughout the Middle Ages. Normans also made their mark in Sicily and southern Italy, with Robert Guiscard's arrival in 1059 leading to the creation of a duchy that eventually evolved into the Kingdom of Sicily. The Angevin dynasty, under the rule of Henry II and his son Richard I, further expanded their territories, ruling over both England and extensive regions of France, acquired through Henry II's family connections.",
        "In 2009, IGN named the Xbox 360 the sixth-greatest video game console of all time, out of a field of 25. Despite not being the top-selling console of its generation, the Xbox 360 was hailed by TechRadar as the most influential, thanks to its emphasis on digital media distribution and online gaming through Xbox Live, as well as its popularization of game achievement awards. PC Magazine even lauded the Xbox 360 as the blueprint for online gaming, demonstrating that online gaming communities could thrive within the console space. Five years after its initial release, the Xbox 360 introduced the highly-praised Kinect motion capture camera, which shattered records as the fastest-selling consumer electronic device in history and breathed new life into the console. Edge magazine went on to rank the Xbox 360 as the second-best console of the 1993–2013 period, highlighting its unique features such as its own social network, cross-game chat, regular releases of new indie games, and the best versions of many multi-platform titles.

        "Vladimir, once the prince of Novgorod, found himself in exile in Scandinavia after the treacherous murder of his brother Oleg by Yaropolk, his half-brother who seized control of Rus. Seeking refuge with his relative Earl Håkon Sigurdsson, ruler of Norway, Vladimir mustered a Viking army that swiftly reclaimed Novgorod and Kiev from Yaropolk's grasp. As the newly appointed Prince of Kiev, Vladimir took on the monumental task of converting the pagan Slavs to Christianity, a decision that would forever alter the course of Kievan Rus'. In a bold move, Vladimir dispatched his most trusted advisors and warriors as emissaries to various corners of Europe, seeking guidance and insight into the teachings of the Christian faith. This pivotal moment marked the beginning of the Christianization of Kievan Rus', a historic transformation that would shape the future of the region.",
        "Galicia's experience during the Spanish Civil War was marked by the success of the initial coup attempt and its subsequent control by Franco's Nationalist forces. Despite avoiding pitched battles, the region faced widespread repression and loss of life. The abolishment of political parties, labor unions, and nationalist organizations like the Seminario de Estudos Galegos left Galicia in a state of authoritarian control. The annulment of the region's autonomy statute further solidified Franco's grip on power. The death toll of at least 4,200 individuals, including republicans, communists, Galician nationalists, socialists, and anarchists, highlights the brutality of the regime. The targeting of civil governors, mayors, and prominent figures like Juana Capdevielle and Ánxel Casal exemplifies the ruthless tactics employed by Franco's forces to maintain control over Galicia.",
        "Fatty acids play a crucial role in the human body, with most being considered non-essential as they can be synthesized as needed by the body. However, there are two essential fatty acids, omega-3 and omega-6, that must be obtained through the diet. Maintaining a proper balance of these essential fatty acids is believed to be important for overall health, although concrete evidence from experiments is still lacking. These omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids serve as substrates for the production of prostaglandins, which are important hormones with various functions in the body. For example, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), an omega-3 fatty acid, can be converted from alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) in the body or obtained from marine sources. EPA is a precursor for series 3 prostaglandins, such as the weakly inflammatory PGE3. On the other hand, dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA), an omega-6 fatty acid, is a precursor for series 1 prostaglandins. These fatty acids play a key role in various physiological processes and maintaining their balance is essential for optimal health.",
        "Within the Roman society, public priests were designated by the collegia, a process that bestowed upon them a significant amount of authority within the religious realm. Once appointed, a priest held a position of perpetual religious power that was believed to be derived from the eternal divine, granting them lifelong influence, privilege, and immunity. As a result, both civil and religious laws were in place to restrict the number and types of religious positions that an individual or their family could occupy. The religious laws were deeply rooted in tradition and were governed by the collegia, playing a crucial role in shaping political decisions and having the ability to overturn them when necessary. It was challenging for individuals to manipulate these laws for personal gain due to their strict regulations. Becoming a priest was considered a prestigious honor; in the traditional Roman practice, priests did not receive any financial compensation for their services. Any donations made to the cult were considered the property of the deity, and it was the responsibility of the priest to ensure that the cult was maintained, even if public funding was insufficient. The path to obtaining a permanent priesthood position typically involved a lifetime of service in the military or politics, or ideally, in both fields, after achieving success in the Cursus honorum.",
        "Following their marriage on April 4, 2008, Beyoncé and Jay Z kept their relationship private until Beyoncé publicly disclosed their union in a video montage during the listening party for her third studio album, I Am...

        "Darwin was diligently working on his comprehensive study on Natural Selection, known as his \"big book\", when he received a package from Wallace on 18 June 1858. Wallace, who was residing in the Maluku Islands, specifically Ternate and Gilolo, had sent him twenty pages outlining an evolutionary mechanism. This mechanism was a response to Darwin's previous encouragement, with Wallace seeking Darwin's opinion on whether it was worth sharing with Lyell. Remarkably, Wallace's theory bore striking similarities to Darwin's own. In correspondence with Lyell, Darwin expressed his astonishment at how his own ideas had been anticipated by Wallace, stating that \"your words have come true with a vengeance, ... forestalled\" and acknowledging that his own original contributions may now be overshadowed. Lyell and Hooker agreed that a joint publication combining Wallace's work with excerpts from Darwin's earlier writings should be presented at the Linnean Society. Consequently, on 1 July 1858, the papers were read under the title \"On the Tendency.\"",
        "In the greater metropolitan area, 13% of the population live below the poverty line, facing numerous challenges and hardships on a daily basis. According to a comprehensive 2012 report submitted by GHMC to the World Bank, Hyderabad is home to a staggering 1,476 slums housing a total population of 1.7 million individuals. Shockingly, 66% of these residents inhabit 985 slums located in the heart of the city, while the remaining 34% reside in 491 suburban tenements. It is disheartening to note that approximately 22% of the slum-dwelling households have migrated from various parts of India in the last decade of the 20th century, seeking better opportunities and livelihoods. Despite their struggles, a significant percentage of these individuals, 63% to be exact, have called these slums their home for more than a decade. The overall literacy rate in these impoverished areas ranges from 60 to 80%, with female literacy lagging behind at 52 to 73%. Basic services such as water, electricity, and sanitation are only available in a third of the slums, leaving the majority of residents dependent on government-provided services. In terms of education, there are 405 government schools, 267 government-aided schools, and 175 private schools striving to provide quality education to the underprivileged youth of these slum communities.",
        "Many modern specialty matches have been created in the world of professional wrestling, each with its own unique set of rules and objectives. One of the most popular specialty matches is the ladder match, where wrestlers or teams must climb a ladder to retrieve a prize suspended above the ring. The ladder match requires strategic planning and physical prowess, as wrestlers must not only fend off their opponents but also navigate the ladder to secure the prize. The prize could vary from a championship belt, a document granting a future title shot, or any other item of significance to the wrestlers involved. Another frequently seen specialty match is the battle royal, where a large number of wrestlers compete in the ring simultaneously. The chaos and unpredictability of a battle royal make it an exciting spectacle for fans, as wrestlers are eliminated one by one until only one remains victorious. Specialty matches like these add an extra layer of excitement and drama to professional wrestling events, showcasing the creativity and skill of the performers involved.",
        "After Cassander's death in 298 BCE, Demetrius, with a large and loyal army and fleet at his disposal, saw an opportunity to seize power in Macedon. In 294 BCE, he invaded Macedon, successfully claiming the throne for himself. Over the next few years, Demetrius expanded his control by conquering Thessaly and most of central Greece. However, his reign was short-lived as he faced strong opposition from Lysimachus of Thrace and Pyrrhus of Epirus, who invaded Macedon in 288 BCE. Despite his initial defeat, Demetrius managed to regroup in central Greece with his mercenaries and garnered support in the northern Peloponnese. He made another attempt to siege Athens, but eventually struck a treaty with the Athenians and Ptolemy. This allowed him to shift his focus to Asia Minor, where he waged war on Lysimachus' territories in Ionia. In 285 BCE, Demetrius was forced to surrender to Seleucus and died in captivity. Meanwhile, his son Antigonus Gonatas took over control in Greece, marking the end of Demetrius' ambitious but tumultuous reign.",
        "Fontenelle's Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds marked a significant shift in scientific writing, as it was one of the first works to cater specifically to a non-academic audience. By targeting women with an interest in science, Fontenelle opened up the world of scientific knowledge to a wider demographic. This approach inspired a wave of similar works that aimed to make complex scientific concepts more accessible to the general public. Leadbetter's Astronomy, for example, promised readers \"short and easie Rules and Astronomical Tables,\" appealing to those who may have found traditional scientific texts too dense or difficult to understand. Voltaire's Eléments de la philosophie de Newton and du Châtelet's translation of the Principia further democratized scientific knowledge, bringing Newton's theories out of the ivory towers of academia and into the mainstream. Algarotti's contributions to popularizing scientific ideas cannot be understated, as his works helped to bridge the gap between scientific elites and the layperson, making complex theories more digestible for a wider audience.",
        "In 633 AD, the Rashidun Arabs launched an invasion of Iran, eventually conquering the region by 651 AD. This military conquest led to the widespread conversion of the Iranian population from their traditional faiths of Manichaeism and Zoroastrianism to Sunni Islam. The Arab conquerors imposed Arabic as the official language of the region, but Persian continued to be spoken by the majority of the population and used in literature. Iran emerged as a significant contributor to the Islamic Golden Age, producing numerous influential scientists, scholars, artists, and thinkers during this period.\n\nThe establishment of the Safavid Dynasty in 1501 brought about a major religious shift in Iran, with the conversion of the population from Sunni Islam to Twelver Shia Islam. This conversion marked a significant turning point in Iranian and Muslim history, as Twelver Shia Islam became the official religion of Iran. Under the rule of Nader Shah from 1736, Iran reached its greatest territorial extent since the Sassanid Empire and briefly held a position as one of the most powerful empires of the time.\n\nHowever, during the 19th century, Iran faced significant challenges and lost territories in the Caucasus to Imperial Russia. This loss of territory, which had been part of the concept of Iran for centuries, was a blow to the country's territorial integrity. The discontent among the population eventually culminated in widespread popular unrest.",
        "The government report, as reported by the Guardian in 2002, sheds light on a disturbing chapter in British history where the Ministry of Defence conducted secret germ warfare tests on the public between 1940 and 1979. These tests involved the release of potentially harmful chemicals and micro-organisms over large areas without the knowledge of the public. The Ministry of Defence states that the purpose of these trials was to simulate germ warfare and that they were harmless. However, families residing in the areas where these tests took place have reported an increase in birth defects and physical and mental handicaps among their children. As a result, there is a growing demand for a public inquiry into the long-term effects of these experiments. The impact of these tests was widespread, with an estimated millions of people being affected. During one specific period from 1961 to 1968, over a million individuals living along the south coast of England were exposed to bacteria such as e.coli and bacillus globigii, which is known to mimic anthrax. The repercussions of these tests continue to be felt by the affected communities, highlighting the need for further investigation and accountability.",
        "The early 1980s marked a significant period of transition for many established hard rock bands. Tragedy struck with the untimely deaths of Bon Scott from AC/DC and John Bonham from Led Zeppelin, leading to the dissolution of the iconic group Led Zeppelin. However, AC/DC persevered with the addition of Brian Johnson as their new lead singer and went on to release the monumental album \"Back in Black\" in 1980. The album's massive success solidified AC/DC's place in rock history, becoming one of the best-selling albums of all time. Meanwhile, Black Sabbath underwent a transformation with the arrival of Ronnie James Dio as their new frontman, resulting in a revitalization of their sound and a string of successful albums starting with \"Heaven and Hell\" in 1980. On the other hand, Ozzy Osbourne embarked on a successful solo career following his departure from Black Sabbath, collaborating with virtuoso guitarist Randy Rhoads on the acclaimed album \"Blizzard of Ozz\" in 1980. As the musical landscape evolved, bands like Queen explored new territories, shifting towards a more pop-oriented sound, while others continued to embrace the hard rock ethos of the past.",
        "Feynman's groundbreaking work in modeling physics through diagrams of particles interacting in spacetime paved the way for a comprehensive understanding of the fundamental forces at play. His exploration of the spins of particles and the extent of their interactions led to the development of the parton model, which sought to explain the strong interactions governing nucleons scattering. This model, while initially met with skepticism and even ridicule from some in the scientific community, emerged as a valuable complement to the quark model put forth by his colleague Murray Gell-Mann. The relationship between these two models was not immediately clear, with Gell-Mann dismissing Feynman's partons as mere \"put-ons.\" However, advancements in experimental physics, such as the Stanford linear accelerator deep inelastic scattering experiments of the late 1960s, ultimately provided evidence supporting the existence of quarks as real particles. This experimental data challenged the prevailing notion that quarks were merely theoretical constructs used for symmetry calculations, demonstrating their essential role in the structure of matter.",
        "On December 13, 2013, Beyoncé made a significant impact in the music industry by unexpectedly releasing her fifth studio album on the iTunes Store with no prior announcement or promotional campaign. The album quickly rose to the top of the Billboard 200 chart, marking Beyoncé's fifth consecutive number-one album in the United States. This achievement solidified her status as the first woman in the history of the chart to have her first five studio albums debut at number one. The album, simply titled \"Beyoncé,\" received both critical acclaim and commercial success, with one million digital copies sold worldwide in just six days. The unconventional and unexpected release strategy of the album was noted by The New York Times as a groundbreaking move in the industry. Musically, \"Beyoncé\" showcased a blend of electro and R&B styles, delving into darker themes that had not been explored in Beyoncé's previous work, such as issues of bulimia, postnatal depression, and the fears and insecurities associated with marriage and motherhood. The album's lead single, \"Drunk in Love,\" featuring Jay Z, reached number two on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Following the album's success, Beyoncé and Jay Z announced their joint On the Run Tour in April 2014, which generated significant anticipation and excitement among fans and critics alike.",
        "Before the early 20th century, treatments for infections were heavily influenced by medicinal folklore, with mixtures containing antimicrobial properties being used as early as over 2000 years ago. Ancient cultures such as the Egyptians and Greeks utilized mold and plant materials to combat infections. The discovery of natural antibacterials by microorganisms in the laboratory further advanced the field of medicine. Louis Pasteur's recognition of the potential therapeutic benefits of intervening in bacterial antagonism marked a significant turning point. The term 'antibiosis' was coined by Jean Paul Vuillemin to describe the phenomenon of early antibacterial drugs, highlighting their ability to combat against life. This concept was first observed in bacteria in 1877, laying the foundation for the development of modern antibiotics.",
        "In countries with three or more parties involved, the likelihood of any one party gaining power on its own is slim. Instead, parties often collaborate to form coalition governments, a practice that has become increasingly common in the Republic of Ireland since the 1980s. This trend is prevalent in Germany as well, both at the national and state levels, and in most constituencies at the communal level. Since the establishment of the Republic of Iceland, coalition governments have been the norm, with the Independence Party and another party, often the Social Democratic Alliance, leading the way. Similarly, in the Republic of Ireland, no single party has held power independently since 1989, leading to the formation of several coalition governments, typically led by either Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael. The flexibility and adaptability of coalition governments often make political change more feasible compared to rigid one-party or two-party dominant systems.",

        "In the grand Senate chamber, where tradition and ceremony reign supreme, the Royal Assent ceremony unfolds with grace and dignity. The hallowed halls are filled with anticipation as the Speaker of the Senate announces the impending arrival of the governor general or their deputy. The atmosphere is charged with solemnity, as the Senate is bound by duty to remain in session until the ceremony is complete. With regal pomp and circumstance, the speaker takes their place beside the ornate throne, flanked by the Mace Bearer holding the symbolic mace of authority. As the governor general enters, all eyes turn towards the majestic figure taking the speaker's chair. The Usher of the Black Rod, a figure of authority and tradition, is then tasked with summoning the Members of Parliament to the Senate chamber. With dignified procession, the members follow Black Rod back to the Senate, the Sergeant-at-Arms carrying the emblematic mace of the House of Commons with reverence. As the members of the commons stand behind the designated bar, Black Rod stands beside the governor general, who, in a gesture of royal approval, nods their head to signify Royal Assent to the bills presented before them, a moment of historic significance and legislative importance. The ceremony concludes with a sense of unity and respect for the democratic process, a reminder of the enduring power and tradition of the Canadian parliamentary system.",
        "As Scotland maintained its independence as a Kingdom, a significant shift occurred in 1603 when the King of Scotland inherited the Crown of England, along with the Crown of Ireland. This marked the beginning of a tumultuous period in the 17th century, characterized by political unrest, religious discord, and warfare. The English colonial presence in Ireland in the 16th century was further expanded with the establishment of large-scale Scottish and English colonies in Ulster. The religious divide deepened, leading to conflicts between the King of England and parliament, particularly regarding his policy of religious tolerance towards Catholicism. The resulting English Civil War, also known as the War of the Three Kingdoms, resulted in the establishment of a revolutionary republic in England. In Ireland, which was predominantly Catholic, there was a strong allegiance to the king. However, following the defeat of the royalist forces by the parliamentary army, extensive land redistribution took place, transferring lands from loyalist Irish nobility to English commoners who had served in the parliamentary army. This marked the beginning of a new Ascendancy class, which over the next century would gradually displace the English (Hiberno-Norman) and Gaelic Irish populations.",
        "The rise of the Maratha Empire in the early 18th century marked a significant turning point in Indian history. Under the leadership of the Peshwas, the Marathas transformed from a kingdom into a formidable empire that challenged the dominance of the Mughals and other regional powers. The Battle of Delhi in 1737, where the Marathas emerged victorious over a Mughal army in their own capital, showcased their military prowess and strategic acumen. Buoyed by this success, the Marathas continued to expand their territory through a series of campaigns against the Mughals, Nizam, Nawab of Bengal, and even the Durrani Empire.\n\nHistorian Gordon's analysis sheds light on the systematic approach adopted by the Marathas in their territorial expansion. The process typically began with annual raids on the targeted region, gradually escalating to the collection of ransom from villages and towns. Despite the Mughal Empire's nominal control, the Marathas were able to assert their dominance and eventually annex the region. For instance, Gordon illustrates this process with the takeover of the Malwa region, where the Marathas established a strong foothold through meticulous planning and execution.\n\nMoreover, the Marathas' efficient system of public administration played a crucial role in their governance of newly acquired territories. Known for their meticulous attention to detail, the Marathas were able to effectively manage the regions under their control, ensuring stability and prosperity. By implementing policies that focused on revenue generation and socio-economic development, the Marathas were able to revitalize districts that had suffered from years of conflict and raids. This not only helped in consolidating their rule but also enabled them to achieve levels of revenue previously enjoyed by the region.",
        "In 1939, the Bureau of Investigation, as the FBI was known at the time, started compiling a list of individuals who would be detained in the event of war with Axis nations. This list predominantly included Issei community leaders, as well as some German and Italian nationals. The FBI's investigation was based on a Naval Intelligence index that had already been focusing on Japanese Americans in Hawaii and the West Coast. Robert Shivers, who headed the Honolulu office, received permission from FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover to begin detaining individuals on the list on December 7, 1941, the same day as the attack on Pearl Harbor. Following the attack, mass arrests and home searches, often conducted without warrants, were carried out within hours. Over the next few weeks, more than 5,500 Issei men were taken into FBI custody. On February 19, 1942, President Franklin Roosevelt issued Executive Order 9066, which authorized the relocation of Japanese Americans from the West Coast. Despite this, FBI Director Hoover had opposed the idea.",
        "In the realm of tiny warriors, neonates stand poised at the edge of a vast battlefield, their immune systems a delicate dance of potential and vulnerability. Like fragile petals unfurling in the morning sun, their bodies hold the promise of strength yet to come. But for now, they navigate a world where danger lurks in every shadow, their defenses still in the tender stages of awakening. In this realm of whispers and shadows, neonates move through a landscape fraught with unseen perils, their innate and adaptive responses but a faint echo of the robust immunity that will one day be theirs. And so they journey, guided by the faint flicker of hope that burns within, their bodies a canvas upon which the story of their resilience is yet to be written.",
        "After gaining independence, the Chief Commissioner's Province of H.P. was established on 15 April 1948 by integrating 28 small princely states and feudal territories in the western Himalayan region, collectively known as the Simla Hills States, along with four southern hill states from Punjab. This integration was formalized through the Himachal Pradesh (Administration) Order, 1948, enacted under the Extra-Provincial Jurisdiction Act, 1947. The State of Bilaspur was later merged with Himachal Pradesh on 1 April 1954, through the Himachal Pradesh and Bilaspur (New State) Act, 1954. With the adoption of the Indian Constitution on 26 January 1950, Himachal Pradesh became a part C state, solidifying its place within the newly formed Republic of India.",
        "The term \"Bleacher Bums\" has been affectionately used to describe a dedicated group of fans who frequent the bleacher section at Wrigley Field. These fans are known for their enthusiastic support of the Chicago Cubs and their lively interactions with players and other spectators. Originally, the group was dubbed \"bums\" due to their consistent attendance at games, which were predominantly held during the day, leading to the assumption that they did not have other commitments. Many of these fans were, and continue to be, students at various Chicago area colleges, including DePaul University, Loyola, Northwestern University, and Illinois-Chicago. The popularity of the Bleacher Bums was further solidified with the success of a Broadway play inspired by their antics, featuring notable actors such as Joe Mantegna, Dennis Farina, Dennis Franz, and James Belushi.",
        "The torch lighting ceremony at AT&T Park was meant to be a symbol of unity and peace between the American and Chinese Olympic officials. However, what was supposed to be a smooth and celebratory event quickly turned into chaos and confusion. The first runner in the relay mysteriously disappeared into a warehouse on a waterfront pier, causing a delay and leaving spectators puzzled. The situation escalated as clashes broke out between pro-China demonstrators, who were allegedly brought in by the Chinese Consulate, and protesters advocating for Tibet and Darfur. The non-Chinese protesters found themselves outnumbered and faced with hostility from the pro-China groups. Eventually, the torch reappeared along Van Ness Avenue, a busy street not originally part of the planned route. Television footage captured the unfolding events, showcasing the unexpected twists and turns of the torch relay in San Francisco.",
        "A standard adult football match is a symphony of time, divided into two halves of 45 minutes each. The clock ticks relentlessly, refusing to pause even for a moment when the ball is out of play. The rhythm of the game is punctuated by a brief intermission, a 15-minute half-time break that offers a moment of respite before the players return to the field for the second act. As the final whistle approaches, the referee becomes the conductor of time, deciding how to account for minutes lost to injuries, substitutions, and other interruptions. This additional time, known as stoppage time or injury time, is a mysterious entity, its duration known only to the referee. With a wave of the hand or a glance at a board held aloft by the fourth official, the referee signals the end of the match, bringing the carefully orchestrated performance to a close.",
        "There is a strong emphasis on the importance of identifying infectious agents when it can directly impact the treatment or prevention of a disease. This is especially true when effective therapeutic or preventative measures are not yet available. One example of this is seen in the early years of the AIDS epidemic, where the monitoring of patient blood samples for the presence of HIV played a crucial role in understanding the progression of the disease. Despite the lack of treatment options at the time, this information was vital in advancing theories on how the virus was transmitted within specific communities. By identifying the routes of transmission, targeted efforts could be made to reduce the spread of the virus in high-risk populations. The development of serological and molecular diagnostic techniques for HIV further contributed to our understanding of the origins and spread of the virus, laying the groundwork for future research and intervention strategies.",
        "With newfound independence, Estonia emerged as the bridge between two worlds, embracing economic reform and aligning itself with the West. Drawing inspiration from the economic principles of Milton Friedman, Estonia boldly implemented a flat tax system in 1994, setting a uniform rate of 26% for all incomes. The country continued to fine-tune its tax policies, steadily reducing the personal income tax rate to 21% by 2008. In a symbolic move towards further integration, Estonia adopted the euro as its currency in 2011, after delays caused by stubborn inflation. Notably, Estonia also enforces a unique Land Value Tax, solely dedicated to funding local municipalities. This state-level tax, with revenues exclusively channeled towards Local Councils, plays a crucial role in Estonia's decentralized governance system. The rate of this tax is carefully determined by the authorities, ensuring sustainable support for community development.",
        "The island of Saint Helena, with its total area of 122 km2 (47 sq mi), is a rugged terrain of volcanic origin, where the remnants of ancient eruptions dating back about 7 million years still linger in the landscape. Along the coast, the ground is blanketed in volcanic rock, giving rise to warmer and drier conditions compared to the lush center of the island. Rising majestically above all is Diana's Peak, towering at 818 m (2,684 ft), a beacon of natural beauty that was designated as the island's first national park in 1996. As one traverses the island, they will encounter vast stretches of New Zealand flax, remnants of a bygone industry that once thrived on Saint Helena. Amidst these plantations, one can still find remnants of the island's original trees, including those nurtured by the Millennium Forest project, a reforestation initiative established in 2002 to replenish a fraction of the lost Great Wood. The island's verdant interior, which was once cloaked in a dense tropical forest, harbors a rich biodiversity that has captivated explorers for centuries. From the unique cabbage tree species to the untamed wilderness that once graced its shores, Saint Helena is a testament to the enduring beauty of nature untouched by time.",
        "The resurgence of established bands in the mid-1980s brought a wave of nostalgia and renewed success to the music industry. Deep Purple, after an 8-year hiatus, reunited with their classic Machine Head line-up to create the critically acclaimed album Perfect Strangers in 1984. This album not only reached number five in the UK but also achieved top five positions in five other countries and was certified platinum in the US. Similarly, Van Halen, following slower sales of their fourth album Fair Warning, experienced a resurgence with their Top 3 album Diver Down in 1982. Their commercial peak came with the release of 1984, which reached number two on the Billboard album chart and produced the chart-topping single \"Jump\". Another band that saw a revival in their career was Heart, who had struggled in the first half of the decade. Their eponymous ninth studio album not only reached number one but also spawned four Top 10 singles, including their first number one hit. The return of these iconic bands marked a significant moment in music history, showcasing the enduring talent and appeal of their timeless music.",
        "Throughout American history, the political landscape has been dominated by a two-party system, with the conservative Republican Party and liberal Democratic Party holding sway. This tradition dates back to the early days of the nation, with the Federalist and Republican parties setting the stage for the political dichotomy that continues to define American politics. As the country evolved, so too did its political parties, with the National Republicans and Democratic Republicans emerging as the dominant forces before giving way to the Whig Party and Democratic Party. The Whigs, however, were short-lived, torn apart by internal divisions over the contentious issue of slavery. This schism ultimately led to the formation of the Republican Party, which attracted anti-slavery members from both the Whigs and Democrats. While third parties, such as the Libertarian Party, have occasionally emerged on the scene, their impact has been limited, with major parties typically emerging victorious in elections. Despite this, third parties have played a significant role in shaping American politics, with notable figures like Theodore Roosevelt and George Wallace garnering support and influencing the outcomes of elections.",
        "Notre Dame's shift in conference affiliations for most of its sports, excluding football and fencing, took place in July 2013 amidst a period of significant conference realignment. The decision to leave the Big East for the ACC was made during a time of uncertainty within the Big East, prompting Notre Dame to seek stability in a new conference home. Despite maintaining football independence, the Irish agreed to play five games per season against ACC opponents as part of their commitment to the conference. In ice hockey, Notre Dame had to navigate a new conference landscape after the Big Ten Conference's expansion to include the sport led to a chain reaction of conference changes, ultimately resulting in the dissolution of the Central Collegiate Hockey Association, the team's former hockey home. Notre Dame subsequently found a new conference in Hockey East. Following their inclusion in the ACC, the conference announced the addition of fencing as a sponsored sport starting in the 2014–15 academic year. While the origins of the Fighting Irish nickname remain subject to speculation, it is widely recognized that the name holds a deep-rooted significance within the university's athletic identity.",
        "Of the 80 torch-bearers in London, Sir Steve Redgrave, who started the relay, addressed the media about the controversy surrounding the event. He acknowledged that he had received e-mailed pleas to boycott the event and understood why some individuals wanted to make a statement. Despite the calls for boycott, some participants like Francesca Martinez and Richard Vaughan refused to carry the torch, while others like Konnie Huq decided to carry it but also took the opportunity to speak out against China's actions. In response to the growing pressure, Member of Parliament Norman Baker urged all torch-bearers to reconsider their involvement. Prime Minister Gordon Brown welcomed the torch outside 10 Downing Street but notably did not hold or touch it. The London relay saw the torch being closely guarded by a \"mobile protective ring\" as described by the BBC. The event was marred by protests from the beginning, with at least thirty-five arrests reported. In one incident, a demonstrator tried to snatch the torch from Konnie Huq, resulting in a brief struggle. Additionally, a fire extinguisher was set off near the torch in a separate incident. Despite the tensions, the Chinese ambassador proudly carried the torch through Chinatown as part of the relay.",
        "The city of Jerusalem holds a significant place in the hearts of Jews, Muslims, and Christians due to its association with key religious sites. Within the Old City alone, there are revered locations such as the Western Wall, the Temple Mount, the Al-Aqsa Mosque, and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. Beyond Jerusalem, other religiously important sites in Israel include Nazareth, known for its significance in Christianity as the place of the Annunciation of Mary; Tiberias and Safed, both considered part of the Four Holy Cities in Judaism; the White Mosque in Ramla, revered in Islam as the shrine of the prophet Saleh; and the Church of Saint George in Lod, which is venerated in both Christianity and Islam as the final resting place of Saint George or Al Khidr. The West Bank also boasts numerous religious landmarks, including Joseph's Tomb in Nablus, the birthplace of Jesus, and Rachel's Tomb in Bethlehem. Despite the spiritual significance of these sites, tensions and conflicts often arise due to the overlapping claims and interpretations of their religious importance.",
        "The placement of non-alphanumeric characters in ASCII encoding was influenced by the layout of mechanical typewriters, particularly the Remington No. 2 which introduced the shift key in 1878. The shifted values of certain characters were based on the layout of these typewriters, with characters like \"#$%_&'() corresponding to their shifted positions. In the early days, typewriters omitted the digits 0 and 1, using the letters O and l instead. However, as these digits became more common, the 1! and 0) pairs became standard. This caused some complications, such as the parentheses not being able to correspond to 9 and 0 because the space character already occupied the place corresponding to 0. To address this, the underscore character was removed to make space for the parentheses in the ASCII encoding.",
        "Adolescence represents a critical period of transition in the dynamics of the family unit, as young individuals navigate the complexities of asserting their independence while maintaining a harmonious relationship with their parents. As children progress through early adolescence, they begin to be perceived by their parents as equals, capable of having a greater say in family decisions. This shift in perception often leads to a rise in parent-child conflicts, particularly during the tumultuous period of puberty. Disagreements between parents and adolescents frequently revolve around issues of control, such as setting curfews, enforcing dress codes, and respecting the adolescent's need for privacy. These conflicts are exacerbated by the influence of peers, who play an increasingly significant role in shaping the adolescent's beliefs and behaviors, sometimes in opposition to parental values. Furthermore, the advent of social media has introduced a new dimension to parent-adolescent disagreements, as parents grapple with the challenges posed by online interactions and digital communication. The evolving nature of family dynamics during adolescence underscores the need for open communication, mutual respect, and a willingness to navigate the inevitable conflicts that arise during this transformative stage of development.",
        "Microbiological culture is a fundamental technique utilized in the field of medicine for diagnosing infectious diseases. This method involves providing a growth medium specific to the infectious agent being tested. A sample is taken from potentially infected tissue or fluid and is then assessed for the presence of an infectious agent that can thrive within the designated medium. Nutrient agar, a solid medium containing essential carbohydrates and proteins for bacterial growth, is commonly used to cultivate most pathogenic bacteria. Upon incubation, a single bacterium will proliferate into a visible mound known as a colony on the surface of the agar plate. These colonies can either remain isolated or merge together to form a continuous \"lawn\". The size, color, shape, and overall appearance of a colony are unique characteristics that can help identify the bacterial species, its strain, and the environmental conditions that support its growth. To aid in identification, additional substances may be added to the agar plate. These substances can support the growth of specific bacteria, providing valuable information for accurate diagnosis.",

        "Brian May and Roger Taylor had initially played together in a band called Smile before forming Queen. Freddie Mercury, who was a fan of Smile, joined the band in 1970 and suggested the new band name, Queen, as well as adopting his iconic stage name. John Deacon was recruited shortly before the recording of their debut album in 1973. Queen's breakthrough in the UK came with their second album, Queen II, in 1974. However, it was the release of Sheer Heart Attack later that year and A Night at the Opera in 1975 that propelled them to international success. The standout track \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" from A Night at the Opera topped the UK charts for nine weeks and revolutionized the music video genre. Their 1977 album, News of the World, featured the anthems \"We Will Rock You\" and \"We Are the Champions\", which have since become synonymous with sporting events.",

        "The history of collegiate a cappella is a rich tapestry of tradition and innovation, with origins that are shrouded in mystery. While the Rensselyrics of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute may lay claim to being one of the oldest known groups, the true birthplace of collegiate a cappella remains a subject of debate among aficionados. The Whiffenpoofs of Yale University, with their illustrious history dating back to 1909 and boasting alumni such as the legendary Cole Porter, stand as a testament to the enduring legacy of collegiate a cappella. As the 20th century unfolded, collegiate a cappella groups flourished and multiplied, each one adding its own unique voice to the ever-growing choir of voices. From the harmonious melodies of Princeton University's Tigertones to the soulful tunes of the University of Rochester YellowJackets, these groups have left an indelible mark on the music scene. The introduction of all-women a cappella groups added a new dimension to the collegiate a cappella landscape, with groups like the Smiffenpoofs of Smith College and The Shwiffs of Connecticut College bringing their own brand of humor and talent to the stage. In this dynamic and ever-evolving world of collegiate a cappella, the only constant is the sheer passion and dedication that each group brings to their craft.",
        "Communication within peer groups is a vital component of an adolescent's journey towards self-discovery and social growth. These groups serve as a safe space for young individuals to navigate their emotions, identity, and social interactions. Through these relationships, adolescents not only learn important social skills like empathy, sharing, and leadership but also discover more about themselves. By surrounding themselves with peers who share similar characteristics, adolescents can find acceptance and support in their journey of self-exploration. The values and norms of these peer groups become intertwined with an individual's own self-concept, shaping their beliefs and behaviors. Through open communication and reflection within these groups, adolescents can express their emotions and concerns without the fear of judgment or rejection. While peer groups can have positive influences on academic motivation and performance, they can also present challenges. Peers may encourage negative behaviors like substance abuse and delinquency through peer pressure, which is especially heightened during early adolescence. Despite the potential pitfalls, peer groups remain a significant aspect of adolescent development, offering both opportunities for growth and obstacles to overcome on the path to adulthood.",
        "As the Liberals entered a period of internal strife, former Treasurer John Howard and former Foreign Minister Andrew Peacock found themselves locked in a fierce battle for leadership. Meanwhile, the Australian economy was grappling with the harsh realities of the early 1990s recession. Unemployment soared to a staggering 11.4% in 1992, sending shockwaves through the nation. In the midst of this economic turmoil, Dr John Hewson took the reins and spearheaded the opposition's ambitious Fightback! policy document in November 1991. This 650-page manifesto outlined a series of bold and controversial measures aimed at ushering in a new era of economic liberalism. Among the proposals were the introduction of a Goods and Services Tax (GST), significant changes to Medicare including the end of bulk billing for non-concession holders, a strict nine-month limit on unemployment benefits, the abolition of awards in industrial relations, a massive $13 billion tax cut for middle and upper income earners, and a whopping $10 billion in government spending cuts. Additionally, the plan called for the elimination of state payroll taxes and the privatization of numerous government-owned enterprises. This marked a stark departure from the traditional Keynesian economic conservatism that had long defined the Liberal/National Coalition's approach to governance. The stage was set for a dramatic shift in Australia's economic landscape.",
        "The allusions to legal issues in To Kill a Mockingbird go beyond the courtroom scenes, capturing the attention of legal scholars. Claudia Durst Johnson highlights the significant amount of critical readings by legal scholars in law journals, surpassing those by literary scholars in literary journals. The quote by Charles Lamb, \"Lawyers, I suppose, were children once,\" sets the tone for exploring the childhood world of Scout and Jem, where discussions on laws and compromises are commonplace. Atticus, as a father and lawyer, navigates through moral dilemmas with his children, questioning the righteousness of Bob Ewell's actions. The symbolic courtrooms in the novel serve as platforms where social norms are challenged, such as Mr. Dolphus Raymond's ostracization for his interracial relationship. Through these interactions, Harper Lee delves into the complexities of societal norms and legal ethics, sparking debates among readers and scholars alike.",

        "The doctrine of Mary's Immaculate Conception, although originating later among Latin theologians, gained prominence in the Byzantine East, particularly among those influenced by Gregory Nazianzen's Mariology. While hymnographers and scholars like Emperor Justinian I referred to Mary as \"prepurified\" in their writings, a more in-depth exploration of this concept can be traced back to Sophronius of Jerusalem. Sophronius asserted that Mary was already immaculate before her purification at the Annunciation, even going as far as to claim that she surpassed the holiness of John the Baptist, who was considered the holiest among men. This idea was further developed by St. John Damascene, who not only praised Mary for her purification at the Annunciation but also credited her with the unique ability to purify the waters of baptism through her touch. These theological reflections highlight the evolving understanding of Mary's purity and holiness in Byzantine theology.",
        "As the torch relay made its way through Hong Kong, tensions ran high as various groups used the event as an opportunity to voice their opinions and demands. The Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China, led by pro-democracy activist Szeto Wah, took to the streets waving inflatable plastic Olympic flames as a symbol of their fight for democracy. They called for justice for the victims of the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989 and urged for democratic reforms in Hong Kong. Legislative Council member Leung Kwok-hung, known as Longhair, also joined in the protest, expressing his pride in the courage of those who dared to speak out in a time of political suppression. However, their calls for democracy were met with backlash from pro-Beijing supporters who hurled insults and accusations at them. Amidst the chaos, a small group from the Civil Human Rights Front held up orange banners calling for human rights improvements and universal suffrage, only to be confronted by onlookers questioning their Chinese identity and attempting to cover their banners with a large Chinese national flag. The scene was a stark reminder of the deep political divisions and conflicting beliefs that permeated society at that time.",
        "Zhejiang's main manufacturing sectors are diverse and include electromechanical industries, textiles, chemical industries, food, and construction materials. Over the years, Zhejiang has developed its own unique development model known as the \"Zhejiang model\". This model emphasizes the importance of promoting entrepreneurship and supporting small businesses that are adaptable to market demands. Additionally, the province has invested heavily in infrastructure and focuses on producing low-cost goods in large quantities for both domestic and international markets. As a result, Zhejiang has become one of the wealthiest provinces in China, and the \"Zhejiang spirit\" has gained a legendary status.

        "The Ottoman madaris were institutions that encompassed a wide range of disciplines, including calligraphic sciences, oral sciences, and intellectual sciences, but their primary purpose was to serve as Islamic centers for spiritual learning. The core belief behind the teachings in these madaris was that the ultimate goal of knowledge, particularly in the spiritual sciences, was to attain knowledge of God. Religion played a significant role in determining the value and relevance of each branch of study, with the general consensus being that sciences that supported religion were considered good, while others, such as astrology, were deemed less favorable. Despite the inclusion of subjects like mathematics and logic in the madrasa curriculum, these disciplines were always taught with a religious context in mind. The scholars of the Ottoman madaris believed that mathematics and logic, despite not being explicitly religious, still played a crucial role in shaping the mind and aiding in the understanding of divine truths. Even philosophy, a subject that was often viewed with suspicion in religious institutions, was permitted in the madaris as long as it did not contradict Islamic teachings. The overarching principle in these institutions was the belief that all knowledge ultimately led back to a deeper understanding of the divine.",
        "The region now known as Galicia has a rich history dating back to the Middle Paleolithic period, when humans first settled in the area. The name Galicia is derived from the Gallaeci, a Celtic people who inhabited the region north of the Douro River during the last millennium BC, coinciding with the Iron Age Castro culture. Galicia was brought under Roman rule at the conclusion of the Cantabrian Wars in 19 BC and was officially established as a Roman province in the 3rd century AD. Following the fall of the Roman Empire, the Germanic Suebi established a kingdom with its capital in Braga (Portugal) in 410, which later became part of the Visigothic kingdom in 585. The Arab invasion of the Iberian Peninsula in 711 resulted in the conquest of the Visigoth kingdom, but by 740 Galicia had become part of the Christian kingdom of Asturias. Throughout the Middle Ages, Galicia was at times governed by its own kings, although it was mostly aligned with the kingdom.",

        "check\n\nThough Britain and the empire emerged victorious from the Second World War, the effects of the conflict were profound, both at home and abroad. The once dominant continent of Europe lay in ruins, with the United States and the Soviet Union now holding the balance of global power. Britain, facing financial ruin, was forced to negotiate a massive loan from the United States to avoid insolvency. This loan, totaling $US 4.33 billion, was finally repaid in 2006. Meanwhile, anti-colonial movements were gaining momentum in European colonies, further complicating the post-war landscape. The escalating Cold War rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union added another layer of complexity to the situation. Despite both nations officially opposing European colonialism, American anti-communism took precedence over anti-imperialism. As a result, the United States supported the continuation of the British Empire in order to prevent Communist expansion. The post-war era was a time of great upheaval and shifting alliances, as the world grappled with the aftermath of the devastating conflict.",
        "Homer's mention of the \"Hellenes\" in his writings refers to a relatively small tribe that was settled in Thessalic Phthia, with its warriors led by Achilleus. According to the Parian Chronicle, Phthia was considered the homeland of the Hellenes, a name that was later given to the people previously known as Greeks (Γραικοί). In Greek mythology, Hellen, the patriarch of the Hellenes, was said to be the son of Pyrrha and Deucalion, who were believed to have ruled around Phthia as the only survivors of a great deluge. This myth likely originated as the Greek tribes began to separate and settle in different regions of Greece, indicating a shared ancestry among them. Aristotle also references ancient Hellas as a significant term in the history of the region.",
        "During the height of World War II, the Luftwaffe posed a significant threat to the British by intensifying their air attacks on Liverpool, a crucial port city for the supply of materials and goods from North America. The German occupation of Western Europe had heightened fears of submarine attacks on Britain's sea communications, potentially disrupting the flow of supplies. Liverpool's strategic importance as a destination for convoys passing through the Western Approaches made it a prime target for German air raids. The Liverpool Blitz saw successful operations that resulted in the sinking of 39,126 long tons of shipping, with an additional 111,601 long tons damaged. The Minister of Home Security, Herbert Morrison, expressed concerns about the impact of these attacks on civilian morale, noting signs of defeatism among the population. The devastation caused by the bombings rendered half of the port's berths unusable and severely reduced cargo unloading capabilities. Roads and railways were blocked, and ships were unable to leave the harbor due to the destruction. The events of 8 May 1941 were particularly devastating, with 57 ships destroyed in a single day, highlighting the destructive power of the Luftwaffe's air raids on Liverpool.",
        "During the reign of King George V, the grandeur of Buckingham Palace underwent a transformation that reflected the changing times. Sir Aston Webb, in 1913, undertook the task of redesigning the East Front of the palace to emulate the elegant style of Giacomo Leoni's Lyme Park in Cheshire. The new façade, crafted from exquisite Portland stone, served as a majestic backdrop to the Victoria Memorial, a magnificent statue of Queen Victoria that stood regally outside the main gates. King George V, known for his serious demeanor, shifted the focus of the palace towards official duties and state functions, foregoing the lavish parties that had been a hallmark of his father's reign. Embracing the cultural shifts of the era, the King arranged command performances featuring jazz musicians such as the Original Dixieland Jazz Band in 1919, Sidney Bechet, and Louis Armstrong in 1932. This move towards embracing modern musical styles earned Buckingham Palace a nomination for a prestigious (Kind of) Blue Plaque by the Brecon Jazz Festival in 2009, recognizing its significant contribution to jazz music in the United Kingdom.",
        "The temporary peace in Europe provided Napoleon with the opportunity to shift his focus towards the French colonies overseas. In particular, the situation in Saint-Domingue, which had gained significant political autonomy during the Revolutionary Wars under the leadership of Toussaint Louverture, caught Napoleon's attention. By 1801, Louverture had established himself as the de facto ruler of the colony. Napoleon seized the chance to regain control of the once prosperous colony after signing the Treaty of Amiens. Despite the National Convention's decision to abolish slavery in February 1794, Napoleon, in accordance with the terms of the treaty, agreed not to abolish slavery in colonies where the decree had never been enforced. This concession led to the enactment of the Law of 20 May, which did not apply to territories like Guadeloupe or Guyane. Taking advantage of the peace, some rogue officials reinstated slavery in these regions. It is important to note that the Law of 20 May primarily focused on reinstating the slave trade in the Caribbean colonies, rather than slavery itself. In response to British pressure, Napoleon dispatched General Leclerc to oversee an expedition aimed at reestablishing French control over the colonies.",
        "Mary's complete sinlessness and exemption from any taint from the first moment of her existence was a belief that had been embraced by Greek theologians in Byzantium for centuries. This doctrine was not only familiar to them but was also deeply ingrained in their understanding of the nature of Mary. St. Gregory Nazianzen, a prominent theologian of the time, played a significant role in shaping this belief. His exploration of the concept of \"purification\" in relation to Jesus and Mary, particularly at the moment of circumcision, led him to view sinlessness as a crucial aspect of their nature. Gregory saw this sinlessness as a manifestation of grace and glory, evident in moments like Jesus' baptism. In his theological framework, Gregory designated Mary as \"prokathartheisa,\" meaning \"prepurified.\" This designation reflected his belief in Mary's inherent holiness and purity. Gregory's teachings on Mary's purification were likely influenced by the growing veneration of the Mother of God in the region around Constantinople, especially during the Christmas season. The title of \"prepurified\" that Gregory bestowed upon Mary at the Annunciation eventually became a cornerstone of Marian theology in the Byzantine tradition.",
        "The state, nestled in its relative calm amidst the turbulent tides of the country, maintained a close connection to the United States until the year 1841. However, the winds of change began to blow in 1843 as the specter of war loomed on the horizon. The state government, sensing the impending storm, swiftly moved to fortify its defense lines along the political boundary with Texas. Weapons were dispatched to bolster the military forces, and efforts were made to enhance the efficiency of the presidios. In a bid to strengthen its defenses further, the state organized the Regimen for the Defenders of the Border, comprising light cavalry, four squads of two brigades, and a small force of 14 men and 42 officials, at a cost of 160,603 pesos annually. As the early 1840s unfolded, vigilant private citizens took it upon themselves to intercept commercial caravans of supplies from the United States. However, with the vast distance separating them from the major suppliers in central Mexico, the caravan was eventually allowed to pass in March 1844. Anticipating an imminent conflict, the state legislature, on July 11, 1846, issued a decree enlisting 6,000 men for the defense of the state.",
        "In the spring of 1800, as the vibrant blossoms of the season painted the landscape with hues of pink and white, Napoleon and his valiant troops embarked on a treacherous journey across the majestic Swiss Alps, their hearts set on reclaiming the glory of Italy from the grasp of the Austrian armies.

        "In Homer's Iliad, the names Danaans (or Danaoi: Δαναοί) and Argives (Argives: Αργείοι) are used to designate the Greek forces opposed to the Trojans. The myth of Danaus, whose origin is Egypt, is a foundation legend of Argos. According to the myth, Danaus' daughters, the Danaides, were condemned in Tartarus to carry out the impossible task of filling a bathtub with a jug that had no bottom. This enduring myth is often associated with the idea of a task that can never be completed, much like the punishment of Sisyphus in Greek mythology. The name Danaans is believed to be derived from the PIE root *danu, which means \"river.\" Despite various theories about their origins, including connections to the sea peoples who attacked Egypt during the reign of Ramesses III, the true source of the Danaans remains uncertain. Some scholars suggest a link between the Danaans and the Denyen, a group believed to have been inhabitants of the city of Adana in Cilicia. The inscription also mentions the Weshesh, who may have been the Achaeans, further complicating the puzzle of the Danaans' true identity.",

        "Adolescence is a crucial stage in a person's life where they begin to form their identity, influenced greatly by their environment. While many studies focus on white, middle class adolescents, research suggests that those from more privileged backgrounds tend to have an easier time developing their sense of self. This period of identity formation is now extending over a longer period of time compared to previous generations, with the transition to adulthood taking place over a span of years. This shift has elevated the importance of youth, encompassing late adolescence and early adulthood, as a significant stage in the life course. As a result, various factors play a key role in shaping an adolescent's social identity, from commitment to coping mechanisms to the impact of social media. These factors are heavily influenced by the environment in which a young person grows up, with those from privileged backgrounds often having access to more opportunities and resources that can aid in their development.",
        "The landscapes of Thuringia showcase a wide variety of geographical features. In the northern region, the imposing Harz mountains dominate the landscape, giving way to the fertile floodplain of the Goldene Aue around Nordhausen. Moving towards the north-west, the hilly and forested Eichsfeld region is characterized by the meandering Leine river. Central and northern Thuringia are encompassed by the expansive Thuringian Basin, a flat and fertile area surrounding the Unstrut river. This basin is encircled by a series of hill chains, including the Dün, Hainleite, Windleite, Kyffhäuser, Hohe Schrecke, Schmücke, Finne, Ettersberg, Steigerwald, Thuringian Forest, Hörselberge, and Hainich. Nestled within the basin are the smaller hill chains of Fahner Höhe and Heilinger Höhen. To the south lies the largest mountain range in the region, consisting of the Thuringian Forest in the north-west, the Thuringian Highland in the middle, and the Franconian Forest. The diverse landscapes of Thuringia offer a rich tapestry of natural beauty and geographical diversity.",
        "The relationships adolescents have with their peers, family, and members of their social sphere are crucial for their social development. During adolescence, individuals rapidly navigate their social sphere and start to differentiate between friends and acquaintances. Friendships hold significant emotional weight for adolescents, and while this is generally positive, it can also lead to vulnerability to peer pressure. Adolescence is a pivotal stage in social development as it marks the beginning of independent decision-making. This newfound autonomy makes adolescents susceptible to the influence of their close relationships. The relationships formed during this period are instrumental in helping adolescents grasp the complexities of social interactions and personal boundaries. Peers, in particular, hold considerable sway over an individual's choices and behaviors, making these relationships pivotal in shaping an adolescent's social development.",

        "Rock musicians today are increasingly incorporating mandolins into their music, with some opting for single-stringed electric models over the more traditional double-stringed acoustic mandolins. One such example is Tim Brennan of the Irish-American punk rock band Dropkick Murphys, who not only plays electric guitar but also utilizes instruments like the mandolin, tin whistle, and Great Highland bagpipes to enhance the band's signature growling sound. Another notable instance of mandolin use in rock music is seen in R.E.M.'s 1991 hit \"Losing My Religion,\" where guitarist Peter Buck's simple yet iconic mandolin licks played a key role in the song's success. Luther Dickinson of North Mississippi Allstars and The Black Crowes is another musician known for his skillful incorporation of the mandolin into his work, showcasing its versatility and ability to add a unique dimension to rock music.",
        "Predators and prey form a complex web of interactions within ecosystems. The relationship between predators and prey is not always straightforward, as organisms can occupy multiple roles in the food chain. For example, blue jays may be predators of insects but can also become prey for other predators such as cats and snakes. This interplay between different trophic levels highlights the dynamic nature of predator-prey relationships. By categorizing predators based on their trophic level, we can better understand the flow of energy within an ecosystem. Herbivores, or primary consumers, feed on autotrophs, while secondary consumers prey on heterotrophs like animals. The concept of tertiary and quaternary consumers further illustrates the complexity of predator-prey dynamics. However, due to the inefficiency of energy transfer between trophic levels, the hierarchy of predation typically only extends to a few levels, with most systems rarely exceeding three trophic levels. This limitation emphasizes the delicate balance that exists within ecosystems and the interconnectedness of all organisms within them.",
        "In the year 680, Ibn al-Zubayr made the decision to flee from Medina to seek refuge in Mecca. Around the same time, news of Husayn's opposition to Yazid I reached the people of Kufa, who then sent a message to Husayn inviting him to lead them with their support. In response to this invitation, Husayn dispatched his cousin Muslim bin Agail to Kufa to assess the level of support he could expect from the people there. However, upon learning of these developments, Yazid I took action by sending Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad, the ruler of Basrah, with the specific directive to thwart any attempts by the people of Kufa to unite under Husayn's leadership. Ubayd-Allah successfully dispersed the crowd that had gathered around Muslim bin Agail and apprehended him. Recognizing that Ubayd-Allah was determined to prevent Husayn from gaining a foothold in Kufa, Muslim bin Agail pleaded for a message to be conveyed to Husayn advising him against relocating to Kufa. However, Ubayd-Allah rejected this plea, thereby signaling his commitment to carrying out Yazid's orders without compromise.",
        "The battle of 1 September 1870 was a fierce and intense clash between the Army of Châlons and the surrounding Prussian Third and Meuse Armies. The French forces, consisting of 202 infantry battalions, 80 cavalry squadrons, and 564 guns, launched a determined attack on the Prussian forces, which boasted 222 infantry battalions, 186 cavalry squadrons, and 774 guns. General De Wimpffen, leading the French V Corps, planned to strike the Prussian XI Corps with a combined infantry and cavalry assault. However, as the day progressed, the Prussian artillery inflicted heavy casualties on the French troops, and more Prussian reinforcements arrived on the battlefield. The French cavalry, under the command of General Marguerite, made three valiant but unsuccessful charges on the village of Floing, where the Prussian XI Corps was positioned. Tragically, General Marguerite was killed leading the first charge, and the subsequent attacks resulted in significant losses for the French. By nightfall, it became apparent that the French forces had little chance of breaking through the Prussian defenses."
