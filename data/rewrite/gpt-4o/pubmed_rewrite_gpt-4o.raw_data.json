From the results of this study, we should not hesitate to offer the definitive surgery for the elderly with aSAH.",
        "Question: Thoracic and thoracoabdominal aneurysm repair: is reimplantation of spinal cord arteries a waste of time? Answer: With monitoring of MEP and SSEP, sacrifice--without reimplantation--of as many as 15 intercostal and lumbar arteries during TAA/A repair is safe, resulting in acceptably low rates of immediate and delayed paraplegia. This experience suggests that routine surgical implantation of segmental vessels is",
        "Question: Diagnostic characteristics of child bipolar I disorder: does the \"Treatment of Early Age Mania (team)\" sample generalize? Answer: Generalization of the RCT sample was supported, because only 7.8% of Phenomenology subjects did not fit the RCT criteria. Nevertheless, because the RCT subjects were more severely ill, it is unclear if treatment findings from the RCT will be applicable to children with less severe mania.",
        "Question: Hypotension in patients with coronary disease: can profound hypotensive events cause myocardial ischaemic events?

        "Question: Does airway surgery lower serum lipid levels in obstructive sleep apnea patients? Answer: Surgery may improve blood lipid levels in patients with OSA, especially in patients with preoperative dyslipidemia, potentially yielding a major benefit in metabolism and cardiovascular sequelae. Prospective studies should examine this",
        "Question: Does preoperative anemia adversely affect colon and rectal surgery outcomes? Answer: This large multicenter database analysis suggests that the presence of severe and moderate and even mild preoperative anemia is an independent risk factor for complications and a longer hospital stay after colon surgery.",

All five VS patients who exhibited significant activation in regions of interest (ROIs) experienced a positive clinical outcome by the end of the observation period. Consequently, we",
        "Question: Are physicians meeting the needs of family caregivers of the frail elderly? Answer: Several hypotheses are proposed to explain this dissatisfaction. One possibility is that physicians might lack interest in assisting caregivers. Another is that even if physicians were open to providing counseling to caregivers, they might receive inadequate compensation for the counseling sessions typically required by caregivers. Additionally, being a professional caregiver to family caregivers could contribute to this issue.",
        "Question: Is there a first night effect on sleep bruxism? Answer: The findings indicated that there was no significant first night effect on the severity of RMMA frequency in young, healthy patients with SB. In a clinical setting, a single night of sleep recording might be adequate for patients with moderate to high SB frequency. However, a second night of recording may be necessary to confirm low RMMA frequency observed on the first night.",

Nonetheless, there isn't a one-size-fits-all solution to decrease maternal mortality, and pinpointing specific issues requires careful consideration.",
        "Question: Aromatase inhibitor-related musculoskeletal symptoms: is preventing osteoporosis the key to eliminating these symptoms? Answer: Patients on aromatase inhibitors (AIs) who develop osteoporosis face a higher risk of musculoskeletal symptoms and bone fractures. Co-medication with calcium and bisphosphonates (Ca/Bis) lowers the chances of experiencing osteoporosis and musculoskeletal issues. Those who took tamoxifen prior to starting AIs were less likely to suffer from AI-related musculoskeletal symptoms. We recommend",

        "Question: Is it necessary to insert a nasobiliary drainage tube routinely after endoscopic clearance of the common bile duct in patients with choledocholithiasis-induced cholangitis? Answer: The regular insertion of an ENBD tube did not enhance the clinical outcome, even though patients had to endure longer procedure times and additional discomfort, making the insertion unnecessary.",
        "Question: Antral follicle assessment as a tool for predicting outcome in IVF--is it a better predictor than age and FSH? Answer: The success of in vitro fertilization is closely linked to maternal age, the basal cycle, day 3 follicle count, stimulated hormone levels, and antral follicle evaluation. Among these factors, antral follicle assessment proved to be a more accurate predictor of in vitro fertilization outcomes than maternal age or follicle-stimulating hormone levels.",
        "Question: Can bedside assessment reliably exclude aspiration following acute stroke?

        "Question: Could the extent of lymphadenectomy be modified by neoadjuvant chemotherapy in cervical cancer? Answer: The frequency and topographic spread of lymph node metastasis (LNM) are not altered by neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT), and patients who do not respond clinically tend to have more affected lymph nodes. Therefore, a thorough and comprehensive lymphadenectomy is recommended for patients undergoing NACT followed by surgery, regardless of their response to the chemotherapy.",
        "Question: The insertion allele of the ACE gene I/D polymorphism. A candidate gene for insulin resistance? Answer: We conclude that the heightened cardiovascular risk associated with the DD genotype is not due to insulin resistance or issues with fibrinolysis.
