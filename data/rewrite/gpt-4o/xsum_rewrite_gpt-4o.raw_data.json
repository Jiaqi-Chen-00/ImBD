However, he warned: \"We must remember that whether you drown one foot under the water or ten foot under the water, you still drown.\" A Â£485m pension deficit was given as a reason for some potential buyers being put off.

The independence referendum led to an increase in numbers of people registering to vote. Expanded electoral rolls were used to identify those who had debts.

Presently, all three and four-year-olds are guaranteed at least 10 hours of education through the Foundation Phase, with each of the 22 councils determining how to deliver these hours and allocating their budgets accordingly.

The independence referendum resulted in more people registering to vote, and expanded electoral rolls were then used to track individuals with debts. The Scottish government assured that local authorities would receive compensation. The poll tax, also known as the community charge, was abolished in 1993, just four years after its implementation in Scotland. Introduced by the Conservative Thatcher government in 1989, the tax replaced the previous rates system and led to widespread street protests due to its unpopularity. In recent years, the amount of poll tax arrears collected by local authorities in Scotland has decreased to less than £350,000 in 2013-14, with some authorities stopping debt recovery entirely.

The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) found that PC Sofi Essex faced a misconduct case for not preparing an \"arrest package\"—necessary paperwork before arrest attempts—when required. \"Although it was eventually completed, the delay meant no action was taken to locate and arrest Craig Hutsby before the rape occurred,\" the report stated.

        "A survey of employees and managers revealed that 25% of new fathers did not take any paternity leave. Less than 10% took more than the statutory two weeks of leave. The Institute of Leadership & Management (ILM) attributed this to \"ingrained\" attitudes among employers and financial concerns among new fathers about taking leave. Last year, the government proposed allowing parents to share maternity and paternity leave, with changes set to begin in April 2015. However, the ILM indicated that these changes might have minimal impact unless employer attitudes are also addressed. \"The introduction of shared parental leave is a crucial step towards enabling more women to progress into senior roles,\" stated Charles Elvin, ILM's chief executive. \"Yet our research uncovered that cultural barriers are hindering the uptake of both the two weeks statutory paternity leave and additional paternity leave.\" He noted that there remains a \"cultural expectation\" within organizations that women, not men, will take on these responsibilities.",

Mainly male, these \"superfans\" are more inclined than typical consumers to purchase music on CDs or as downloads. This information stems from a survey of 504 UK residents who attended at least one festival in the past year. Eventbrite, the ticketing website that commissioned the survey, notes that these \"superfans\" significantly \"drive the music festivals market,\" often recommending music and events to friends. They represent 28% of the festival audience, with over half (54%) willing to attend events alone. On average, they spend £45 more per event compared to casual fans, but their loyalty isn't assured: 46% feel festivals are becoming \"too corporate.\" The UK hosts over 100 music festivals annually, ranging from major events like Glastonbury and T In The Park to smaller festivals.",

        "The boat suffered extensive damage when a submarine entangled its fishing nets and dragged it backward 18 miles off the County Down coast in April. According to the skipper, his crew was fortunate to escape without injury, estimating the repair costs at around £10,000. The Ministry of Defence has now confirmed that a British submarine was involved in the incident. Initially, they refrained from commenting on submarine operations. However, \"new information\" revealed that a UK submarine was indeed responsible for damaging the boat, named the MV Karen, according to the Royal Navy. In a written statement to the House of Commons, Armed Forces Minister Penny Mordaunt expressed deep regret for the incident, the delay in identifying and addressing the events of that day, and their consequences. She explained that the mishap occurred because the submarine failed to correctly recognize the Karen as a fishing vessel with active nets.",
        "Kian Delos Santos was fatally shot by police who claimed he was involved in the drug trade and resisted arrest. However, surveillance footage seems to capture the 17-year-old being dragged away by plainclothes officers. Evidence indicates that he was kneeling, face down, when he was killed. Hundreds of mourners attended his funeral in Manila. Some held signs demanding an end to President Duterte's violent campaign, which has garnered support from many frustrated by drug-related crime in the Philippines. Nuns, priests, and hundreds of children chanting \"justice for Kian, justice for all\" accompanied the procession from a church to the cemetery where he was laid to rest, according to Reuters. During the Mass, his father, Saldy, briefly spoke to assert his son's innocence and express his anger at the police. \"Don't they have a heart?\" he asked emotionally. \"I'm not sure they do. There are a lot of churches; they should go there.\"",

He faces 50 charges of indecent assault alleged to have occurred from the 1970s to the 1990s at St William's in Market Weighton, East Riding of Yorkshire, which he denies. Two other former staff members from the same home, which was run by the Catholic De La Salle order and has since closed, were also put on trial earlier. Mr. Carragher, who led St William's from 1976 to 1990, along with two other men, is accused of abusing 19 former pupils.

At 93, Mr. Mugabe, who has ruled since Zimbabwe's independence from Britain in 1980, plans to seek re-election. \"This is just the beginning of the building blocks towards establishing a broad alliance to confront Zanu-PF between now and the next election,\" Mr. Tsvangirai told journalists. The alliance represents a crucial first step in uniting a fragmented opposition.

Judge Persky faced criticism for his perceived leniency in the June 2016 sentencing of Stanford University swimmer Brock Turner. Turner, who could have received up to 14 years in prison, was sentenced to six months but served only three months in county jail for the January 2015 assault. The recall petition states, \"Judge Aaron Persky shocked the world when he sentenced Stanford swimmer Brock Turner to six months in jail for sexually assaulting an unconscious woman behind a dumpster at a fraternity party.\" Michele Dauber, a Stanford law professor spearheading the recall effort with 50 community leaders, stated in a news conference: \"Santa Clara County residents deserve a judge who will protect victims, not rapists.

George Kemp from Maryport, Cumbria, emerged as the winner, despite battling a chest infection. His winning story involved an encounter with Donald Trump and his wife in an underwater hotel. Kemp explained that his tale revolved around constructing a small submarine from his father's old bubble car. During a trip to the Isle of Man, this bubble car submarine led to encounters with various celebrities within a Scottish submarine made of shortbread tins. Notably, Nicola Sturgeon and Alex Salmond were said to have sold some of these giant shortbread tin submarines to the United States.

Ms. Huws expressed hope that her report marked the \"beginning of the end\" for patients being unable to receive healthcare \"suitable to their needs.\" Ministers welcomed the report and committed to responding within six months. The inquiry, which gathered experiences from over a thousand Welsh speakers, discovered that 90% believed they should have the right to use Welsh when interacting with the NHS, regardless of their location in Wales. Additional findings showed that Welsh speakers who contributed to the inquiry often felt awkward and had difficulty expressing their feelings to English-speaking doctors. The report presents 33 recommendations to the Welsh government, urging ministers to offer a \"clear policy lead\" to primary care providers, along with an \"action plan\" and a \"timetable for change.\"",
        "The bill seeks to annul sections of the UK's 2016 Trade Union Act, altering current limitations on industrial actions within the NHS, the fire service, schools, and other devolved Welsh services. UK ministers contend that industrial relations fall under Westminster's jurisdiction. A significant aspect of the UK law requires strikes to have the support of 40% of a union's members in a ballot. However, the Welsh Assembly's Equality, Local Government, and Communities Committee members agreed that new legislation is essential to sustain Wales' \"social-partnership\" model. In March, Welsh Finance Secretary Mark Drakeford declared it would be a \"democratic outrage\" if London ministers blocked the Welsh Trade Union Bill. The Labour Welsh Government maintains that UK ministers should not enforce union activity restrictions in Wales on devolved services like the NHS and schools.

However, an investigation by BBC London and Newsnight uncovered systematic cheating. Carl Rhymer from the Construction Industry Training Board (CITB), one of the test providers, revealed that 6,000 cardholders would need to retake the exam. The CSCS (Construction Skills Certification Scheme) cards are considered the leading certification for builders in the UK and are required by nine of the country's largest construction firms, including Crossrail and Heathrow. The investigation revealed that many test centers were offering guaranteed passes for money, allowing non-English-speaking workers to gain qualifications and access dangerous construction sites.

This marks a significant shift for the site, which had been dedicated to heavy industry until the central colliery's closure in 1983, ending nearly 200 years of industrial use. Certain parts of the area have already been acknowledged for their environmental significance, with the mudflats and an \"island\" off the foreshore designated as a Special Protection Area.

Flower, from Verwood, Dorset, received a six-month conditional discharge and was ordered to pay £930 in costs. A district judge at Bournemouth Magistrates' Court concluded he violated laws under the Localism Act 2011. Outside the court, Flower did not comment on his political future, expressing surprise and disappointment at the court's decision, which he termed a technicality.

All of Syria's chemical weapons are set to be destroyed by 30 June. The agreement between Russia and the United States to eliminate Syria's chemical arsenal was established last year following a deadly sarin rocket attack near Damascus that killed hundreds. The multinational effort to dispose of these weapons is managed by the UN Security Council and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW). Although the UN's deadline for the complete destruction of Syria's chemical weapons is 30 June, Damascus had pledged to finish removing its stockpile by 27 April, after already missing several deadlines. \"The bulk of the chemical weapons materials has been removed but not yet destroyed, and this is crucial for the 30 June deadline. Therefore, it is vital to retrieve the remaining chemical weapons materials still at one site,\" stated Ms. Kaag, head of the OPCW-UN mission."
