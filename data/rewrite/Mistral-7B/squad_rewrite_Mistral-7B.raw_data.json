        "Like the reptiles, birds are primarily uricotelic, that is, their kidneys extract nitrogenous waste from their bloodstream and excrete it as uric acid instead of urea or ammonia through the ureters into the intestine. Birds do not have a urinary bladder or external urethral opening and (with exception of the ostrich) uric acid is excreted along with feces as a semisolid waste. However, birds such as hummingbirds can be facultatively ammonotelic, excreting most of the nitrogenous wastes as ammonia. They also excrete creatine, rather than creatinine like mammals. This material, as well as the output of the intestines, emerges from the bird's cloaca. The cloaca is a multi-purpose opening: waste is expelled through it, most birds mate by joining cloaca, and females lay eggs from it. In addition, many species of birds regurgitate pellets. Males within Palaeognathae (with the exception of the kiwis), the Anseriformes (with the",
        "Mammalian hair, also known as pelage, can vary in color between populations, organisms within a population, and even on the individual organism. Light-dark color variation is common in the mammalian taxa. Sometimes, this color variation is determined by age variation, however, in other cases, it is determined by other factors. Selective pressures, such as ecological interactions with other populations or environmental conditions, often lead to the variation in mammalian coloration. These selective pressures favor certain colors in order to increase survival. Camouflage is thought to be a major selection pressure shaping coloration in mammals, although there is also evidence that sexual selection, communication, and physiological processes may influence the evolution of coloration as well. Camouflage is the most predominant mechanism for color variation, as",
        "Education in Israel is highly valued in the national culture with its historical values dating back to Ancient Israel and was viewed as one fundamental blocks of ancient Israelite life. Israeli culture views higher education as the key to higher mobility and socioeconomic status in Israeli society. The emphasis of education within Israeli society goes to the gulf within the Jewish diaspora from the Renaissance and Enlightenment Movement all the way to the roots of Zionism in the 1880s. Jewish communities in the Levant were the first to introduce compulsory education for which the organized community, not less than the parents, was responsible for the education of the next generation of Jews. With contemporary Jewish culture's strong emphasis, promotion of scholarship and learning and the strong propensity to promote cultivation of intellectual pursuits as well as the nations high university educational attainment rate exemplifies how highly Israeli society values higher education. The Israeli education system has been praised",

        "Following the fall of Wu and the turmoil of the Wu Hu uprising against the Jin dynasty (265\u2013420), most of elite Chinese families had collaborated with the non-Chinese rulers and military conquerors in the north. Some may have lost social privilege, and took refugee in areas south to Yangtze River. Some of the Chinese refugees from north China might have resided in areas near Hangzhou. For example, the clan of Zhuge Liang (181\u2013234), a chancellor of the state of Shu Han from Central Plain in north China during the Three Kingdoms period, gathered together at the suburb of Hangzhou, forming an exclusive, closed village Zhuge Village (Zhege Cun), consisting of villagers all with family name \"Zhuge\". The village has intentionally isolated itself from the surrounding communities for centuries to this day, and only recently came to be known in public. It suggests that a small number of powerful, elite Chinese refugees from the Central Plain might have taken refugee in",
        "The '98 season would begin on a somber note with the death of legendary broadcaster Harry Caray. After the retirement of Sandberg and the trade of Dunston, the Cubs had holes to fill and the signing of Henry Rodr\u00edguez, known affectionately as \"H-Rod\" to bat cleanup provided protection for Sammy Sosa in the lineup, as Rodriguez slugged 31 round-trippers in his first season in Chicago. Kevin Tapani led the club with a career high 19 wins, Rod Beck anchored a strong bullpen and Mark Grace turned in one of his best seasons. The Cubs were swamped by media attention in 1998, and the team's two biggest headliners were Sosa and rookie flamethrower Kerry Wood. Wood's signature performance was one-hitting the Houston Astros, a game in which he tied the major league record of 20 strikeouts in nine innings. His torrid strikeout numbers earned Wood the nickname \"Kid K,\" and ultimately earned him the 1998 NL Rookie of the Year award. Sosa caught fire in June, hitting a major league record 20 home runs in the",
        "In contemporary society, adolescents also face some risks as their sexuality begins to transform. While some of these, such as emotional distress (fear of abuse or exploitation) and sexually transmitted infections/diseases (STIs/STDs), including HIV/AIDS, are not necessarily inherent to adolescence, others such as teenage pregnancy (through non-use or failure of contraceptives) are seen as social problems in most western societies. One in four sexually active teenagers will contract an STI. Adolescents in the United States often chose \"anything but intercourse\" for sexual activity because they mistakenly believe it reduces the risk of STIs. Across the country, clinicians report rising diagnoses of herpes and human papillomavirus (HPV), which can cause genital warts, and is now thought to affect 15 percent",
        "Throughout the history of the South Slavs, the vernacular, literary, and written languages (e.g. Chakavian, Kajkavian, Shtokavian) of the various regions and ethnicities developed and diverged independently. Prior to the 19th century, they were collectively called \"Illyric\", \"Slavic\", \"Slavonian\", \"Bosnian\", \"Dalmatian\", \"Serbian\" or \"Croatian\". As such, the term Serbo-Croatian was first used by Jacob Grimm in 1824, popularized by the Vienna philologist Jernej Kopitar in the following decades, and accepted by Croatian Zagreb grammarians in 1854 and 1859. At that time, Serb and Croat lands were still part of the Ottoman and Austrian Empires. Officially, the language was called variously Serbo-Croat, Croato-Serbian, Serbian and Croatian, Croatian and Serbian, Serbian or Croatian, Croatian or Serbian. Unofficially, Serbs and Croats typically called the language \"Serbian\" or \"Croatian\", respectively, without implying a distinction between the two, and again in independent Bosnia and Herzegovina, \"Bosnian\", \"Croatian\", and \"Serbian\" were considered to be three names of a single",
        "Identity development is a stage in the adolescent life cycle. For most, the search for identity begins in the adolescent years. During these years, adolescents are more open to 'trying on' different behaviours and appearances to discover who they are. In other words, in an attempt to find their identity and discover who they are adolescents are liking to cycle through a number of identities to find one that suits them best. But, developing and maintaining identity (in adolescent years) is a difficult task due to multiple factors such as family life, environment, and social status. Empirical studies suggest that this process might be more accurately described as identity development, rather than formation, but confirms a normative process of change in both content and structure of",
        "The vast Seleucid Empire was, like Egypt, mostly dominated by a Greco-Macedonian political elite. The Greek population of the cities who formed the dominant elite were reinforced by emigration from Greece. These cities included newly founded colonies such as Antioch, the other cities of the Syrian tetrapolis, Seleucia (north of Babylon) and Dura-Europos on the Euphrates. These cities retained traditional Greek city state institutions such as assemblies, councils and elected magistrates, but this was a facade for they were always controlled by the royal Seleucid officials. Apart from these cities, there were also a large number of Seleucid garrisons (choria), military colonies (katoikiai) and Greek villages (komai) which the Seleucids planted throughout the empire to cement their rule. This 'Greco-Macedonian' population (which also",

This becomes increasing challenging in stigmatized jobs or \"dirty work\" (Hughes, 1951). Tracy and Trethewey (2005) state that \"individuals gravitate toward and turn away from particular jobs depending in part, on the extent to which they validate a \"preferred organizational self\" (Tracy & Tretheway 2005, p. 169).

        "Emotions can motivate social interactions and relationships and therefore are directly related with basic physiology, particularly with the stress systems. This is important because emotions are related to the anti-stress complex, with an oxytocin-attachment system, which plays a major role in bonding. Emotional phenotype temperaments affect social connectedness and fitness in complex social systems (Kurt Kortschal 2013). These characteristics are shared with other species and taxa and are due to the effects of genes and their continuous transmission. Information that is encoded in the DNA sequences provides the blueprint for assembling proteins that make up our cells. Zygotes require genetic information from their parental germ cells, and at every speciation event, heritable traits that have enabled its ancestor to",
        "Stanley Schachter formulated his theory on the earlier work of a Spanish physician, Gregorio Mara\u00f1\u00f3n, who injected patients with epinephrine and subsequently asked them how they felt. Interestingly, Mara\u00f1\u00f3n found that most of these patients felt something but in the absence of an actual emotion-evoking stimulus, the patients were unable to interpret their physiological arousal as an experienced emotion. Schachter did agree that physiological reactions played a big role in emotions. He suggested that physiological reactions contributed to emotional experience by facilitating a focused cognitive appraisal of a given physiologically arousing event and that this appraisal was what defined the subjective emotional experience. Emotions were thus a result of two-stage process: general physiological arousal, and experience of emotion. For example, the physiological arousal, heart pounding, in a response to an evoking stimulus, the sight of a bear in the kitchen.",
        "The political turmoil continued. John began to explore an alliance with the French king Philip II, freshly returned from the crusade. John hoped to acquire Normandy, Anjou and the other lands in France held by Richard in exchange for allying himself with Philip. John was persuaded not to pursue an alliance by his mother. Longchamp, who had left England after Walter's intervention, now returned, and argued that he had been wrongly removed as justiciar. John intervened, suppressing Longchamp's claims in return for promises of support from the royal administration, including a reaffirmation of his position as heir to the throne. When Richard still did not return from the crusade, John began to assert that his brother was dead or otherwise permanently lost. Richard had in fact been captured en route to England by the Duke of Austria and was handed over to Emperor Henry VI, who held him for ransom. John seized the opportunity and went",
        "Early Modern universities initially continued the curriculum and research of the Middle Ages: natural philosophy, logic, medicine, theology, mathematics, astronomy (and astrology), law, grammar and rhetoric. Aristotle was prevalent throughout the curriculum, while medicine also depended on Galen and Arabic scholarship. The importance of humanism for changing this state-of-affairs cannot be underestimated. Once humanist professors joined the university faculty, they began to transform the study of grammar and rhetoric through the studia humanitatis. Humanist professors focused on the ability of students to write and speak with distinction, to translate and interpret classical texts, and to live honorable lives. Other scholars within the university were affected by the humanist approaches to learning and their linguistic expertise in relation to ancient texts, as well as the ideology that advocated the ultimate importance of those texts. Professors of medicine such as Niccol\u00f2 Leoniceno, Thomas Linacre and William Cop were often trained in and taught from a humanist perspective as",

In 1861, Mayor Fernando Wood called on the aldermen to declare independence from Albany and the United States after the South seceded, but his proposal was not acted on. Anger at new military conscription laws during the American Civil War (1861\u20131865), which spared wealthier men who could afford to pay a $300 (equivalent to $5,766 in 2016) commutation fee to hire a substitute, led to the Draft Riots of 1863, whose most visible participants were ethnic Irish working class. The situation deteriorated into attacks on New York's elite, followed by attacks on black New Yorkers and their property after fierce competition for a decade between Irish immigrants and blacks for work. Rioters burned the Colored Orphan Asylum to the ground, but more than 200 children escaped harm due to efforts of the",
        "But in the mid-18th century, during the French Enlightenment, a more ideological use of the term had come into use. In 1765, the author of an anonymous article in a French Enlightenment periodical spoke of \"The general love of humanity ... a virtue hitherto quite nameless among us, and which we will venture to call 'humanism', for the time has come to create a word for such a beautiful and necessary thing\". The latter part of the 18th and the early 19th centuries saw the creation of numerous grass-roots \"philanthropic\" and benevolent societies dedicated to human betterment and the spreading of knowledge (some Christian, some not). After the French Revolution, the idea that human virtue could be created by human reason alone independently from traditional religious institutions, attributed by opponents of the Revolution to Enlightenment philosophes such as Rousseau, was violently",
        "The result was a sequence of innovative but unpopular financial measures.[nb 10] John levied scutage payments eleven times in his seventeen years as king, as compared to eleven times in total during the reign of the preceding three monarchs. In many cases these were levied in the absence of any actual military campaign, which ran counter to the original idea that scutage was an alternative to actual military service. John maximised his right to demand relief payments when estates and castles were inherited, sometimes charging enormous sums, beyond barons' abilities to pay. Building on the successful sale of sheriff appointments in 1194, John initiated a new round of appointments, with the new incumbents making back their investment through increased fines and penalties, particularly in the forests. Another innovation of Richard's, increased charges levied on widows who wished to remain single, was expanded under John. John continued to sell charters for new towns, including",
        "A number of novel ideas about religion developed with the Enlightenment, including Deism and talk of atheism. Deism, according to Thomas Paine, is the simple belief in God the Creator, with no reference to the Bible or any other miraculous source. Instead, the Deist relies solely on personal reason to guide his creed, which was eminently agreeable to many thinkers of the time. Atheism was much discussed, but there were few proponents. Wilson and Reill note that, \"In fact, very few enlightened intellectuals, even when they were vocal critics of Christianity, were true atheists. Rather, they were critics of orthodox belief, wedded rather to skepticism, deism, vitalism, or perhaps pantheism.\" Some followed Pierre Bayle and argued that atheists could indeed be moral men. Many others like Voltaire held that without belief in a God who punishes evil, the moral order of society was undermined. That is, since atheists gave themselves to no Supreme Authority and no law, and had no fear of",
        "Sleep does not affect acquisition or recall while one is awake. Therefore, sleep has the greatest effect on memory consolidation. During sleep, the neural connections in the brain are strengthened. This enhances the brain\u2019s abilities to stabilize and retain memories. There have been several studies which show that sleep improves the retention of memory, as memories are enhanced through active consolidation. System consolidation takes place during slow-wave sleep (SWS). This process implicates that memories are reactivated during sleep, but that the process doesn\u2019t enhance every memory. It also implicates that qualitative changes are made to the memories when they are transferred to long-term store during sleep. When you are sleeping, the hippocampus replays the events of the day for the neocortex. The neocortex then reviews and processes memories, which moves them into long-term memory. When you do not get enough sleep it makes it more difficult to learn as these neural connections are not as strong, resulting in a lower",
        "Although people often think that memory operates like recording equipment, it is not the case. The molecular mechanisms underlying the induction and maintenance of memory are very dynamic and comprise distinct phases covering a time window from seconds to even a lifetime. In fact, research has revealed that our memories are constructed. People can construct their memories when they encode them and/or when they recall them. To illustrate, consider a classic study conducted by Elizabeth Loftus and John Palmer (1974) in which people were instructed to watch a film of a traffic accident and then asked about what they saw. The researchers found that the people who were asked, \"How fast were the cars going when they smashed into each other?\" gave higher estimates than those who were asked, \"How fast were the cars going when they hit each other?\" Furthermore, when asked a week later whether they have seen broken glass in the film, those who had been asked the question with smashed were twice more likely to report that they have seen broken",

The kingdom of Yue began to appear in the chronicles and records written during the Spring and Autumn Period. According to the chronicles, the kingdom of Yue was located in northern Zhejiang. Shiji claims that its leaders were descended from the Shang founder Yu the Great. Evidence suggests that Baiyue and the kingdom of Yue possessed their own culture and history that are different from those kingdoms in north and central China, whose cultures and histories were carefully recorded in chronicles and histories during the Spring and Autumn Period and into the Qin dynasty.

        "Protestantism also spread from the German lands into France, where the Protestants were nicknamed Huguenots. Calvin continued to take an interest in the French religious affairs from his base in Geneva. He regularly trained pastors to lead congregations there. Despite heavy persecution, the Reformed tradition made steady progress across large sections of the nation, appealing to people alienated by the obduracy and the complacency of the Catholic establishment. French Protestantism came to acquire a distinctly political character, made all the more obvious by the conversions of nobles during the 1550s. This established the preconditions for a series of conflicts, known as the French Wars of Religion. The civil wars gained impetus with the sudden death of Henry II of France in 1559. Atrocity and outrage became the defining characteristics of the time, illustrated at their most intense in the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre of August 1572, when the Roman Catholic party annihilated between 30,000 and 100,000 Huguenots across France. The wars",

These exhibition games, most of which are held in the month of August, are played for the purpose of helping coaches narrow down the roster from the offseason limit of 90 players to the regular-season limit of 53 players. While the scheduling formula is not as rigid for preseason games as they are for the regular season, there are numerous restrictions and traditions that limit the choices of preseason opponents; teams are also restricted on what days and times they can play these games.

Madison issued four religious proclamations while President, but vetoed two bills on the grounds they violated the first amendment. On the other hand, both Jefferson and Madison attended religious services at the Capitol.

        "The works of Virgil almost from the moment of their publication revolutionized Latin poetry. The Eclogues, Georgics, and above all the Aeneid became standard texts in school curricula with which all educated Romans were familiar. Poets following Virgil often refer intertextually to his works to generate meaning in their own poetry. The Augustan poet Ovid parodies the opening lines of the Aeneid in Amores 1.1.1\u20132, and his summary of the Aeneas story in Book 14 of the Metamorphoses, the so-called \"mini-Aeneid\", has been viewed as a particularly important example of post-Virgilian response to the epic genre. Lucan's epic, the Bellum Civile has been considered an anti-Virgilian epic, disposing with the divine mechanism, treating historical events, and diverging drastically from Virgilian epic practice. The Flavian poet Statius in his 12-book epic Thebaid engages closely with the poetry of Virgil; in his epilogue he advises his poem not to \"rival the divine Aeneid, but follow afar and ever venerate its footsteps.\" In Silius Italicus, Virgil",

Eastland believes that the founders of affirmative action did not anticipate how the benefits of affirmative action would go to those who did not need it, mostly middle class minorities. Additionally, she argues that affirmative action carries with it a stigma that can create feelings of self-doubt and entitlement in minorities. Eastland believes that affirmative action is a great risk that only sometimes pays off, and that without it we would be able to compete more freely with one another. Libertarian economist Thomas Sowell identified what he says are negative results of affirmative action in his book, Affirmative Action Around the World: An Empirical Study.

        "By far the largest military action in which the United States engaged during this era was the War of 1812. With Britain locked in a major war with Napoleon's France, its policy was to block American shipments to France. The United States sought to remain neutral while pursuing overseas trade. Britain cut the trade and impressed seamen on American ships into the Royal Navy, despite intense protests. Britain supported an Indian insurrection in the American Midwest, with the goal of creating an Indian state there that would block American expansion. The United States finally declared war on the United Kingdom in 1812, the first time the U.S. had officially declared war. Not hopeful of defeating the Royal Navy, the U.S. attacked the British Empire by invading British Canada, hoping to use captured territory as a bargaining chip. The invasion of Canada was a debacle, though concurrent wars with Native Americans on the western front (Tecumseh's War and the Creek War) were more successful.

The Qing court sent forces to defeat Yaqub Beg and Xinjiang was reconquered, and then the political system of China proper was formally applied onto Xinjiang.

Prior to that time BYU teams competed in the Western Athletic Conference. All teams are named the \"Cougars\", and Cosmo the Cougar has been the school's mascot since 1953. The school's fight song is the Cougar Fight Song. Because many of its players serve on full-time missions for two years (men when they're 18, women when 19), BYU athletes are often older on average than other schools' players. The NCAA allows students to serve missions for two years without subtracting that time from their eligibility period.

He responded by attempting to punish Innocent personally and to drive a wedge between those English clergy that might support him and those allying themselves firmly with the authorities in Rome. John seized the lands of those clergy unwilling to conduct services, as well as those estates linked to Innocent himself; he arrested the illicit concubines that many clerics kept during the period, only releasing them after the payment of fines; he seized the lands of members of the church who had fled England, and he promised protection for those clergy willing to remain loyal to him. In many cases, individual institutions were able to negotiate terms for managing their own properties and keeping the produce of their estates. By 1209 the situation showed no signs of resolution, and Innocent threatened to excommunicate John if he did not acquiesce to Langton's appointment. When this threat failed, Innocent",

The popular description of the order was: \"To keep the hair, you lose the head; To keep your head, you cut the hair.\" To the Manchus, this policy was a test of loyalty and an aid in distinguishing friend from foe. For the Han Chinese, however, it was a humiliating reminder of Qing authority that challenged traditional Confucian values. The Classic of Filial Piety (Xiaojing) held that \"a person's body and hair, being gifts from one's parents, are not to be damaged.\" Under the Ming dynasty, adult men did not cut their hair but instead wore",

An exclusive boundary arises, for example, when a person adopts a marker that imposes restrictions on the behaviour of others. An inclusive boundary is created, by contrast, by the use of a marker with which other people are ready and able to associate. At the same time, however, an inclusive boundary will also impose restrictions on the people it has included by limiting their inclusion within other boundaries. An example of this is the use of a particular language by a newcomer in a room full of people speaking various languages. Some people may understand the language used by this person while others may not. Those who do not understand it might take the newcomer's use of this particular language merely as a neutral sign of identity.

In the UK, Nicole records, made of celluloid or a similar substance coated onto a cardboard core disc, were produced for a few years beginning in 1904, but they suffered from an exceptionally high level of surface noise. In the United States, Columbia Records introduced flexible, fiber-cored \"Marconi Velvet Tone Record\" pressings in 1907, but the advantages and longevity of their relatively noiseless surfaces depended on the scrupulous use of special gold-plated Marconi Needles and the product was not a success. Thin, flexible plastic records such as the German Phonycord and the British Filmophone and Goodson records appeared around 1930 but also did not last long.

The date of the assignment was retroactively established on Armistice Day. It is doubtful whether a referendum in Strasbourg would have ended in France's favour since the political parties striving for an autonomous Alsace or a connection to France accounted only for a small proportion of votes in the last Reichstag as well as in the local elections. The Alsatian autonomists who were pro French had won many votes in the more rural parts of the region and other towns since the annexation of the region by Germany in 1871.

        "As Western Europe witnessed the formation of new kingdoms, the Eastern Roman Empire remained intact and experienced an economic revival that lasted into the early 7th century. There were fewer invasions of the eastern section of the empire; most occurred in the Balkans. Peace with Persia, the traditional enemy of Rome, lasted throughout most of the 5th century. The Eastern Empire was marked by closer relations between the political state and Christian Church, with doctrinal matters assuming an importance in eastern politics that they did not have in Western Europe. Legal developments included the codification of Roman law; the first effort\u2014the Theodosian Code\u2014was completed in 438. Under Emperor Justinian (r. 527\u2013565), another compilation took place\u2014the Corpus Juris Civilis.

        "When Nintendo released the NES in the US, the design styling was deliberately different from that of other game consoles. Nintendo wanted to distinguish its product from those of competitors and to avoid the generally poor reputation that game consoles had acquired following the video game crash of 1983. One result of this philosophy was to disguise the cartridge slot design as a front-loading zero insertion force (ZIF) cartridge socket, designed to resemble the front-loading mechanism of a VCR. The newly designed connector worked quite well when both the connector and the cartridges were clean and the pins on the connector were new. Unfortunately, the ZIF connector was not truly zero insertion force. When a user inserted the cartridge into the NES, the force of pressing the cartridge down and into place bent the contact pins slightly, as well as pressing the cartridge\u2019s ROM board back into the cartridge itself. Frequent insertion and removal of cartridges caused the pins to wear out from repeated usage over the years and the ZIF",
        "Protestants also took the initiative in advocating for religious freedom. Freedom of conscience had high priority on the theological, philosophical, and political agendas since Luther refused to recant his beliefs before the Diet of the Holy Roman Empire at Worms (1521). In his view, faith was a free work of the Holy Spirit and could, therefore, not be forced on a person. The persecuted Anabaptists and Huguenots demanded freedom of conscience, and they practised separation of church and state. In the early seventeenth century, Baptists like John Smyth and Thomas Helwys published tracts in defense of religious freedom. Their thinking influenced John Milton and John Locke's stance on tolerance. Under the leadership of Baptist Roger Williams, Congregationalist Thomas Hooker, and Quaker William Penn, respectively, Rhode Island, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania combined democratic constitutions with freedom of religion. These colonies became safe havens for persecuted religious minorities, including Jews.

        "Birds have a very efficient system for diffusing oxygen into the blood; birds have a ten times greater surface area to gas exchange volume than mammals. As a result, birds have more blood in their capillaries per unit of volume of lung than a mammal. The arteries are composed of thick elastic muscles to withstand the pressure of the ventricular constriction, and become more rigid as they move away from the heart. Blood moves through the arteries, which undergo vasoconstriction, and into arterioles which act as a transportation system to distribute primarily oxygen as well as nutrients to all tissues of the body. As the arterioles move away from the heart and into individual organs and tissues they are further divided to increase surface area and slow blood flow. Travelling through the arterioles blood moves into the capillaries where gas exchange can occur. Capillaries are organized into capillary beds in tissues, it",

In the United States, much (though not all) of the former streetcar system in Washington, D.C.

They find that the figure of 85% is misleading because it implies that all human populations contain on average 85% of all genetic diversity. They claim that this does not correctly reflect human population history, because it treats all human groups as independent. A more realistic portrayal of the way human groups are related is to understand that some human groups are parental to other groups and that these groups represent paraphyletic groups to their descent groups. For example, under the recent African origin theory the human population in Africa is paraphyletic to all other human groups because it represents the ancestral group from which all non-African populations derive, but more than that, non-African groups only derive from a small non-representative sample of",

Gaddafi welcomed these reforms, calling for wide-scale privatization in a March 2003 speech. In 2003, the oil industry was largely sold to private corporations, and by 2004, there was $40 billion of direct foreign investment in Libya, a sixfold rise over 2003. Sectors of Libya's population reacted against these reforms with public demonstrations, and in March 2006, revolutionary hard-liners took control of the GPC cabinet; although scaling back the pace of the changes, they did not halt them.

In a notable letter to Marshal Soult detailing the plan for the campaign, Napoleon described the essential features of Napoleonic warfare and introduced the phrase le bataillon-carr\u00e9 ('square battalion'). In the bataillon-carr\u00e9 system, the various corps of the Grande Arm\u00e9e would march uniformly together in close supporting distance. If any single corps was attacked, the others could quickly spring into action and arrive to help. Napoleon invaded Prussia with 180,000 troops, rapidly marching on the right bank of the River Saale. As in previous campaigns, his fundamental objective was to destroy one opponent before reinforcements from another could tip the balance of the war. Upon learning the whereabouts of the Prussian army, the French swung westwards and crossed the Saale with overwhelming force. At the twin battles of Jena and Auerstedt, fought on 14 October, the French convincingly defeated",
        "Regarding the timing of German rapprochement, many historians agree that the dismissal of Maxim Litvinov, whose Jewish ethnicity was viewed unfavorably by Nazi Germany, removed an obstacle to negotiations with Germany. Stalin immediately directed Molotov to \"purge the ministry of Jews.\" Given Litvinov's prior attempts to create an anti-fascist coalition, association with the doctrine of collective security with France and Britain, and pro-Western orientation by the standards of the Kremlin, his dismissal indicated the existence of a Soviet option of rapprochement with Germany.[f] Likewise, Molotov's appointment served as a signal to Germany that the USSR was open to offers. The dismissal also signaled to France and Britain the existence of a potential negotiation option with Germany. One British official wrote that Litvinov's disappearance also meant the loss of an admirable technician or shock-absorber, while Molotov's \"modus operandi\" was \"more truly Bolshevik than diplomatic or cosmopolitan.\" Carr argued that the Soviet Union's replacement of Foreign",

According to critics, the Libyan people lived in a climate of fear under Gaddafi's administration, due to his government's pervasive surveillance of civilians. Gaddafi's Libya was typically described by western commentators as \"a police state\".

Predators may hunt actively for prey in pursuit predation, or sit and wait for prey to approach within striking distance, as in ambush predators. Some predators kill large prey and dismember or chew it prior to eating it, such as a jaguar or a human; others may eat their (usually much smaller) prey whole, as does a bottlenose dolphin swallowing a fish, or a snake, duck or stork swallowing a frog. Some animals that kill both large and small prey for their size (domestic cats and dogs are prime examples) may do either depending upon the circumstances; either would devour a large insect whole but dismember a rabbit. Some predation entails venom that subdues a prey creature before the predator ingests the prey by killing, which the",

Wang and Nyima argue that these were not diplomatic delegations at all, that Tibetan areas were ruled by the Ming since Tibetan leaders were granted positions as Ming officials, that horses were collected from Tibet as a mandatory \"corv\u00e9e\" tax, and therefore Tibetans were \"undertaking domestic affairs, not foreign diplomacy\". Sperling writes that the Ming simultaneously bought horses in the Kham region while fighting Tibetan tribes in Amdo and receiving Tibetan embassies in Nanjing.

Moulting is annual in most species, although some may have two moults a year, and large birds of prey may moult only once every few years. Moulting patterns vary across species. In passerines, flight feathers are replaced one at a time with the innermost primary being the first. When the fifth of sixth primary is replaced, the outermost tertiaries begin to drop. After the innermost tertiaries are moulted, the secondaries starting from the innermost begin to drop and this proceeds to the outer feathers (centrifugal moult). The greater primary coverts are moulted in synchrony with the primary that they overlap. A small number of species, such as",

Contrary to popular belief, there is no empirical evidence for a significant drop in self-esteem over the course of adolescence. \"Barometric self-esteem\" fluctuates rapidly and can cause severe distress and anxiety, but baseline self-esteem remains highly stable across adolescence.

        "Successful cultivation of cotton requires a long frost-free period, plenty of sunshine, and a moderate rainfall, usually from 600 to 1,200 mm (24 to 47 in). Soils usually need to be fairly heavy, although the level of nutrients does not need to be exceptional. In general, these conditions are met within the seasonally dry tropics and subtropics in the Northern and Southern hemispheres, but a large proportion of the cotton grown today is cultivated in areas with less rainfall that obtain the water from irrigation. Production of the crop for a given year usually starts soon after harvesting the preceding autumn. Cotton is naturally a perennial but is grown as an annual to help control pests. Planting time in spring in the Northern hemisphere varies from the beginning of February to the beginning of June. The area of the United States known as the South Plains",
        "The book was widely translated in Darwin's lifetime, but problems arose with translating concepts and metaphors, and some translations were biased by the translator's own agenda. Darwin distributed presentation copies in France and Germany, hoping that suitable applicants would come forward, as translators were expected to make their own arrangements with a local publisher. He welcomed the distinguished elderly naturalist and geologist Heinrich Georg Bronn, but the German translation published in 1860 imposed Bronn's own ideas, adding controversial themes that Darwin had deliberately omitted. Bronn translated \"favoured races\" as \"perfected races\", and added essays on issues including the origin of life, as well as a final chapter on religious implications partly inspired by Bronn's adherence to Naturphilosophie. In 1862, Bronn produced a second edition based on the third English edition and Darwin's suggested additions, but then died of a heart attack. Darwin corresponded closely with Julius Victor Carus, who published an improved translation in 1867. Darwin's",

In Scandinavia, with the help of his relative Earl H\u00e5kon Sigurdsson, ruler of Norway, Vladimir assembled a Viking army and reconquered Novgorod and Kiev from Yaropolk. As Prince of Kiev, Vladimir's most notable achievement was the Christianization of Kievan Rus', a process that began in 988.

It enclosed twenty pages describing an evolutionary mechanism, a response to Darwin's recent encouragement, with a request to send it on to Lyell if Darwin thought it worthwhile. The mechanism was similar to Darwin's own theory. Darwin wrote to Lyell that \"your words have come true with a vengeance, ... forestalled\" and he would \"of course, at once write and offer to send [it] to any journal\" that Wallace chose, adding that \"all my originality, whatever it may amount to, will be smashed\".

Iran became a major contributor to the Islamic Golden Age, producing many influential scientists, scholars, artists, and thinkers. Establishment of the Safavid Dynasty in 1501, converted the Iranian people from Sunni Islam to Twelver Shia Islam, and made Twelver Shia Islam the official religion of Iran. Safavid conversion of Iran from Sunnism to Shiism marked one of the most important turning points in Iranian and Muslim history. Starting in 1736 under Nader Shah, Iran reached its greatest territorial extent since the Sassanid Empire, briefly possessing what was arguably the most powerful empire at the time.

The relationship between the two models was murky; Gell-Mann referred to Feynman's partons derisively as \"put-ons\". In the mid-1960s, physicists believed that quarks were just a bookkeeping device for symmetry numbers, not real particles, as the statistics of the Omega-minus particle, if it were interpreted as three identical strange quarks bound together, seemed impossible if quarks were real.

After an 8-year separation, Deep Purple returned with the classic Machine Head line-up to produce Perfect Strangers (1984), which reached number five in the UK, hit the top five in five other countries, and was a platinum-seller in the US. After somewhat slower sales of its fourth album, Fair Warning, Van Halen rebounded with the Top 3 album Diver Down in 1982, then reached their commercial pinnacle with 1984. It reached number two on the Billboard album chart and provided the track \"Jump\", which reached number one on the singles chart and remained there for several weeks.

        "The United States has become essentially a two-party system. Since a conservative (such as the Republican Party) and liberal (such as the Democratic Party) party has usually been the status quo within American politics. The first parties were called Federalist and Republican, followed by a brief period of Republican dominance before a split occurred between National Republicans and Democratic Republicans. The former became the Whig Party and the latter became the Democratic Party. The Whigs survived only for two decades before they split over the spread of slavery, those opposed becoming members of the new Republican Party, as did anti-slavery members of the Democratic Party. Third parties (such as the Libertarian Party) often receive little support and are very rarely the victors in elections. Despite this, there have been several examples of third parties siphoning votes from major parties that were expected to win (such as Theodore Roosevelt in the election of 1912 and George Wallace in the election of 1968).",

The Irish left the Big East for the ACC during a prolonged period of instability in the Big East; while they maintain their football independence, they have committed to play five games per season against ACC opponents. In ice hockey, the Irish were forced to find a new conference home after the Big Ten Conference's decision to add the sport in 2013\u201314 led to a cascade of conference moves that culminated in the dissolution of the school's former hockey home, the Central Collegiate Hockey Association, after the 2012\u201313 season.

        "Adolescence marks a rapid change in one's role within a family. Young children tend to assert themselves forcefully, but are unable to demonstrate much influence over family decisions until early adolescence, when they are increasingly viewed by parents as equals. The adolescent faces the task of increasing independence while preserving a caring relationship with his or her parents. When children go through puberty, there is often a significant increase in parent\u2013child conflict and a less cohesive familial bond. Arguments often concern minor issues of control, such as curfew, acceptable clothing, and the adolescent's right to privacy, which adolescents may have previously viewed as issues over which their parents had complete authority. Parent-adolescent disagreement also increases as friends demonstrate a greater impact on one another, new influences on the adolescent that may be in opposition to parents' values. Social media has also played an increasing role in adolescent and parent disagreements. While parents never had to worry about the threats of social",

Peer groups offer members the opportunity to develop social skills such as empathy, sharing, and leadership. Adolescents choose peer groups based on characteristics similarly found in themselves. By utilizing these relationships, adolescents become more accepting of who they are becoming. Group norms and values are incorporated into an adolescent\u2019s own self-concept. Through developing new communication skills and reflecting upon those of their peers, as well as self-opinions and values, an adolescent can share and express emotions and other concerns without fear of rejection or judgment. Peer groups can have positive influences on an individual, such as on academic motivation and performance. However, while peers may facilitate social development for one another they may also hinder it. Peers can have negative influences, such as encouraging experimentation with drugs, drinking, vandalism, and stealing through peer pressure. Susceptibility to peer pressure increases during early adolescence, peaks around age 14, and declines thereafter. Further evidence of peers",

Although hymnographers and scholars, like the Emperor Justinian I, were accustomed to call Mary \"prepurified\" in their poetic and credal statements, the first point of departure for more fully commenting on Nazianzen's meaning occurs in Sophronius of Jerusalem. In other places Sophronius explains that the Theotokos was already immaculate, when she was \"purified\" at the Annunciation and goes so far as to note that John the Baptist is literally \"holier than all 'Men' born of woman\" since Mary's surpassing holiness signifies that she was holier than even John after his sanctification in utero. Sophronius' teaching is augmented and incorporated by St. John Damascene (d. 749/750). John, besides many passages wherein he extolls the Theotokos for her purification at the Annunciation, grants her the unique honor of \"purifying the waters of baptism by touching them.\" This",

As a result, Zhejiang has made itself one of the richest provinces, and the \"Zhejiang spirit\" has become something of a legend within China.

Beginning with St. Gregory Nazianzen, his explanation of the \"purification\" of Jesus and Mary at the circumcision (Luke 2:22) prompted him to consider the primary meaning of \"purification\" in Christology (and by extension in Mariology) to refer to a perfectly sinless nature that manifested itself in glory in a moment of grace (e.g., Jesus at his Baptism). St. Gregory Nazianzen designated Mary as \"prokathartheisa (prepurified).\" Gregory likely attempted to solve the riddle of the Purification of Jesus and Mary in the Temple through considering the human natures of Jesus and Mary as equally holy and therefore both purified in this manner of grace and glory. Gregory's doctrines surrounding Mary's purification were likely related to the burgeoning commemoration of the Mother of God in and around Constantinople very close to the date of Christmas.

It has been recently found that demographic patterns suggest that the transition to adulthood is now occurring over a longer span of years than was the case during the middle of the 20th century. Accordingly, youth, a period that spans late adolescence and early adulthood, has become a more prominent stage of the life course. This therefore has caused various factors to become important during this development. So many factors contribute to the developing social identity of an adolescent from commitment, to coping devices, to social media. All of these factors are affected by the environment an adolescent grows up in. A child from a more privileged upbringing is exposed to more opportunities and better situations in general.",
        "The landscapes of Thuringia are quite diverse. The far north is occupied by the Harz mountains, followed by the Goldene Aue, a fertile floodplain around Nordhausen with the Helme as most important river. The north-west includes the Eichsfeld, a hilly and sometimes forested region, where the Leine river emanates. The central and northern part of Thuringia is defined by the 3000 km\u00b2 wide Thuringian Basin, a very fertile and flat area around the Unstrut river and completely surrounded by the following hill chains (clockwise from the north-west): D\u00fcn, Hainleite, Windleite, Kyffh\u00e4user, Hohe Schrecke, Schm\u00fccke, Finne, Ettersberg, Steigerwald, Thuringian Forest, H\u00f6rselberge and Hainich.

        "The relationships adolescents have with their peers, family, and members of their social sphere play a vital role in the social development of an adolescent. As an adolescent's social sphere develops rapidly as they distinguish the differences between friends and acquaintances, they often become heavily emotionally invested in friends. This is not harmful; however, if these friends expose an individual to potentially harmful situations, this is an aspect of peer pressure. Adolescence is a critical period in social development because adolescents can be easily influenced by the people they develop close relationships with. This is the first time individuals can truly make their own decisions, which also makes this a sensitive period. Relationships are vital in the social development of an adolescent due to the extreme influence peers can have over an individual. These relationships become significant because they begin to help the adolescent understand the concept",

        "Some rock musicians today use mandolins, often single-stringed electric models rather than double-stringed acoustic mandolins. One example is Tim Brennan of the Irish-American punk rock band Dropkick Murphys. In addition to electric guitar, bass, and drums, the band uses several instruments associated with traditional Celtic music, including mandolin, tin whistle, and Great Highland bagpipes. The band explains that these instruments accentuate the growling sound they favor. The 1991 R.E.M. hit \"Losing My Religion\" was driven by a few simple mandolin licks played by guitarist Peter Buck, who also played the mandolin in nearly a dozen other songs. The single peaked at No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart (#1 on the rock and alternative charts), Luther Dickinson of North Mississippi Allstars and The Black Crowes has made frequent use of the mandolin, most notably on",
        "Predators are often another organism's prey, and likewise prey are often predators. Though blue jays prey on insects, they may in turn be prey for cats and snakes, and snakes may be the prey of hawks. One way of classifying predators is by trophic level. Organisms that feed on autotrophs, the producers of the trophic pyramid, are known as herbivores or primary consumers; those that feed on heterotrophs such as animals are known as secondary consumers. Secondary consumers are a type of carnivore, but there are also tertiary consumers eating these carnivores, quartary consumers eating them, and so forth. Because only a fraction of energy is passed on to the next level, this hierarchy of predation must end somewhere, and very seldom goes higher than five or six levels, and may go only as high as three trophic levels (for example, a lion that preys upon large herbivores such as wildebeest, which",

When the news reached Yazid I, he sent Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad, ruler of Basrah, with the instruction to prevent the people of Kufa rallying behind Al-Husayn. Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad managed to disperse the crowd that gathered around Muslim bin Agail and captured him.

General De Wimpffen, the commander of the French V Corps in reserve, hoped to launch a combined infantry and cavalry attack against the Prussian XI Corps. But by 11:00, Prussian artillery took a toll on the French while more Prussian troops arrived on the battlefield. The French cavalry, commanded by General Marguerite, launched three desperate attacks on the nearby village of Floing where the Prussian XI Corps was concentrated.

        "Like reptiles, birds predominantly excrete nitrogenous waste as uric acid rather than urea or ammonia, a process known as uricotely. Unlike mammals, birds lack a urinary bladder and external urethral opening, and instead, uric acid is expelled along with feces as a semi-solid waste. However, certain bird species, such as hummingbirds, can be facultatively ammonotelic, releasing most nitrogenous waste as ammonia. Additionally, birds, unlike mammals, excrete creatine instead of creatinine. This waste, along with the contents of the intestines, is discharged from the bird's cloaca. The cloaca serves multiple purposes, including excretion, reproduction (most birds mate by joining cloaca), and egg-laying. Furthermore, many bird species regurgitate pellets. Males from the Palaeognathae (except for kiwis) and Anseriformes (with exceptions) are known to do this.",
        "Mammalian fur, often referred to as pelage, exhibits color diversity across populations, individuals within a population, and even within a single organism. Commonly observed among various mammal species is a light-to-dark color spectrum. The color variation can be influenced by factors such as age or other specific factors. For instance, some species may display color changes with age, whereas others may display a more complex color pattern due to external factors. The driving forces behind these variations, such as interactions with other species or environmental conditions, often shape the coloration of mammals. These pressures favor certain colors to enhance survival. Camouflage is believed to be a significant factor influencing the coloration of mammals, although it's not the only factor. Sexual selection, communication, and physiological processes are also thought to play a role in the evolution of coloration. Camouflage is the most common mechanism for color variation, as it aids in blending with the surroundings. However, other factors may also impact the evolution of color in mammals.",
        "Education in Israel holds significant value within its national culture, stemming from historical values traced back to Biblical Israel. In the Israeli cultural perspective, higher education serves as a critical pathway to increased social mobility and economic status. The significance of education within Israeli society can be traced back to the Jewish diaspora from the Renaissance and Enlightenment era, leading up to the emergence of Zionism in the 1880s. Jewish communities in the Levant were the first to implement mandatory education, with the organized community, not just the parents, responsible for the education of the next generation of Jews. Contemporary Jewish culture's focus on scholarship, learning, and intellectual pursuits, coupled with Israel's high university enrollment rate, demonstrates the high value placed on higher education in Israeli society. The Israeli education system has earned praise for its commitment to academic excellence.",

        "After the downfall of Wu and the chaos caused by the Wu Hu rebellion against the Jin dynasty (265\u2013420), many prominent Chinese families chose to ally with non-Chinese rulers and conquerors in the north. Consequently, some may have relinquished their social status and fled to regions south of the Yangtze River. A portion of these Chinese refugees from northern China could have settled around Hangzhou. An illustrative example is the Zhuge clan, whose notable member Zhuge Liang (181\u2013234) was a chancellor in the state of Shu Han from the Central Plain during the Three Kingdoms era. This clan congregated in the outskirts of Hangzhou, establishing a secluded village named Zhuge Village (Zhege Cun), inhabited exclusively by villagers sharing the surname \"Zhuge\". For centuries, this village has deliberately remained insulated from neighboring communities, only emerging into public knowledge relatively recently. This indicates that a select group of influential, high-ranking Chinese refugees from the Central Plain might have sought refuge in this area.",

With Sandberg's retirement and Dunston's trade, the Cubs faced gaps to bridge, and the recruitment of Henry Rodr\u00edguez, fondly called \"H-Rod,\" to bat clean-up provided shielding for Sammy Sosa in the lineup. Rodriguez clobbered 31 homers in his debut season in Chicago. Kevin Tapani posted a career-best 19 wins for the team, Rod Beck bolstered a formidable relief corps, and Mark Grace delivered one of his finest seasons. The Cubs were engulfed in media frenzy in 1998, and the team's most prominent figures were Sosa and rookie pitcher Kerry Wood. Wood's standout performance was a one-hitter against the Houston Astros, where he equaled the major league record of 20 strikeouts in nine innings. His staggering strikeout statistics earned Wood the moniker \"Kid K,\" and eventually led to him receiving the 1998 NL Rookie of the Year award.

Approximately 25% of sexually active teenagers will acquire an STI. American adolescents frequently opt for non-intercourse activities as a means of sexual expression, assuming it decreases the chances of contracting STIs.

        "Throughout the evolution of the South Slavic language, distinct dialects, literary tongues, and written forms (such as Chakavian, Kajkavian, Shtokavian) emerged and evolved separately in various regions and among different ethnicities. Before the 19th century, these dialects were commonly referred to as \"Illyric,\" \"Slavic,\" \"Slavonian,\" \"Bosnian,\" \"Dalmatian,\" \"Serbian,\" or \"Croatian.\" In 1824, the term \"Serbo-Croatian\" was coined by Jacob Grimm, gained widespread recognition through the work of Vienna philologist Jernej Kopitar in the following years, and was officially accepted by grammarians in Zagreb, Croatia, in 1854 and 1859. It's worth noting that at that time, both Serbian and Croatian lands were under the rule of the Ottoman and Austrian Empires. The language was officially called various names like Serbo-Croat, Croato-Serbian, Serbian and Croatian, Croatian and Serbian, Serbian or Croatian, Croatian or Serbian. Informally, however, the Serbs and Croats often referred to the language as \"Serbian\" or \"Croatian,\" respectively, without distinguishing",

Through these years, adolescents are inclined to experiment with diverse behaviors and appearances as a means of self-identification. To put it another way, they tend to cycle through various identities to identify the one that best resonates with their true selves. However, establishing and preserving identity during adolescence can be challenging due to a multitude of factors, including family dynamics, surrounding influences, and social standing. Empirical research indicates that this journey may be more precisely defined as identity development, rather than simply formation, while still upholding a normative pattern of change in both the substance and structure of identity formation.",

Among these cities were newly established settlements such as Antioch, the cities of the Syrian tetrapolis, Seleucia (north of Babylon), and Dura-Europos on the Euphrates. These urban centers preserved traditional Greek polis institutions such as assemblies, councils, and elected officials, but these were merely a veneer over the fact that they were consistently supervised by Seleucid royal officials. Beyond these cities, there were also numerous Seleucid military outposts (choria), colonies (katoikiai), and Greek settlements (komai) that the Seleucids established throughout their empire to solidify their control.

One such implication of identity and self-construction is observed in occupational environments. This becomes increasingly complex in jobs that are stigmatized or classified as \"dirty work\" (Hughes, 1951). According to Tracy and Trethewey (2005), individuals tend to be drawn to or avoid certain jobs based on their alignment with a \"preferred organizational self\" (Tracy & Tretheway 2005, p. 169). Different occupations hold varying stigmas or prestige. Tracy (2005) provides the example of correctional officers struggling to break free from the label of \"glorified maids\" (Tracy & Tretheway 2005). The process by which individuals rationalize and value their occupational choices can be traced to factors such as job satisfaction and overall quality of life (Tracy & Scott 2006, p. 33).

This connection is significant as emotions relate to the anti-stress complex, featuring an oxytocin-bonding system that significantly contributes to affiliation. Emotional traits and temperaments influence social cohesion and reproductive success within intricate social structures (Kurt Kottschal, 2013). These traits are observable in various species and taxa and are the result of gene effects and their continuous transmission.

        "Great! Here's the rephrased version of the original text: Stanley Schachter's theory was built upon the earlier research of Spanish physician Gregorio Mara\u00f1\u00f3n, who administered epinephrine to patients and then asked them about their feelings. It was intriguing that most of these patients reported feeling something, yet they were unable to attribute their bodily responses to a specific emotion, as there was no actual emotion-inducing stimulus present. Schachter concurred that physiological responses played a crucial role in emotions. He proposed that physiological responses facilitated a focused cognitive assessment of a particular event, which was causing their physiological arousal, and this assessment was what defined the subjective emotional experience. In essence, emotions arise from a two-stage process: first, general physiological arousal, and second, the experience of an emotion. For example, the physiological response, such as a racing heart, to a stimulus, like seeing a bear in the kitchen, would trigger the second stage of the emotional experience.",

John aimed to gain Normandy, Anjou, and other French territories owned by Richard, in exchange for his allegiance to Philip. However, John's mother, Longchamp, dissuaded him from pursuing the alliance. Longchamp, who had left England due to Walter's mediation, returned, claiming he had been unjustly removed as justiciar. John intervened, silencing Longchamp's demands in exchange for backing from the royal administration, including a reiteration of his status as the heir apparent. Meanwhile, Richard remained absent from the crusade, leading John to argue that his brother was either deceased or irretrievably lost. Unbeknownst to John, Richard had been captured on his way to England by the Duke of Austria and handed over to Emperor Henry VI, who demanded a ransom for his release. Seizing this chance, John acted accordingly.",
        "Initially, Early Modern universities adhered to the scholarly pursuits and curriculum of the Medieval era, encompassing natural philosophy, logic, medicine, theology, mathematics, astronomy (and astrology), law, grammar, and rhetoric. Aristotle held a significant position in the curriculum, while medicine drew heavily on Galen and Arabic scholarship. The advent of humanism significantly altered this academic landscape. When humanist professors started to integrate into university faculties, they initiated a transformation in the study of grammar and rhetoric through the studia humanitatis. Humanist educators emphasized students' ability to write and speak eloquently, to translate and interpret classical texts, and to lead virtuous lives. Furthermore, other scholars within the university were influenced by the humanist approach to learning, their expertise in ancient texts, and the ideology that celebrated the value of these texts. Medical professors such as Niccol\u00f2 Leoniceno, Thomas Linacre, and William Cop were frequently immersed in and taught from a humanist perspective. \u200c",

In 1861, Mayor Fernando Wood advocated for a declaration of independence from Albany and the United States following the South's secession, yet his suggestion went unimplemented. Hostility towards new military draft laws during the American Civil War (1861-1865), which allowed wealthier men to avoid service by paying a $300 (approximately $5,766 in 2016) fee to hire substitutes, resulted in the Draft Riots of 1863. The riots, primarily participated in by the working-class Irish ethnic community, escalated into assaults on New York's elite and, subsequently, attacks on African-American New Yorkers and their possessions, as a result of a decade of intense competition between Irish immigrants and African-Americans for employment opportunities. During the riots, the Colored Orphan Asylum was set ablaze; however, more than 200 children were spared harm due to the efforts of concerned individuals.",

In 1765, an anonymous author wrote an article in a French Enlightenment publication, advocating for \"The universal affection for mankind... a previously unnamed virtue among us, which we shall audaciously dub 'humanism', as it is now appropriate to coin a term for such a splendid and crucial concept\". The latter part of the 18th and early 19th centuries witnessed the establishment of numerous grassroots organizations, both philanthropic and benevolent, with a focus on improving human welfare and disseminating knowledge (some Christian, some not). After the French Revolution, the notion that human morality could be cultivated through human reason alone, separate from traditional religious establishments, was associated by revolution opponents with Enlightenment philosophers such as Rousseau, sparking intense controversy.",

Notably, these payments were often imposed in the absence of any military campaign, contradicting the initial conception that scutage served as an alternative to actual military duty. King John aggressively exercised his right to collect relief payments upon inheritance of estates and castles, even demanding excessive amounts that exceeded the barons' financial capabilities. Following the successful sale of sheriff positions in 1194, King John launched a new round of appointments, with the new appointees recouping their investment through heightened fines and penalties, especially in the forests. Another fiscal initiative, the increased charges levied on widows who chose to remain unmarried, was escalated under King John. Furthermore, King John continued to sell charters for new towns, including several new additions.",
        "During the Enlightenment period, several new perspectives on religion emerged, including Deism and debates surrounding atheism. Deism, as defined by Thomas Paine, is the belief in a creator God, uncoupled from any religious texts or miraculous references. Adherents of Deism rely solely on their individual reason to shape their beliefs, which resonated with many thinkers of the time. Atheism was a topic of conversation, but it had few advocates. Scholars Wilson and Reill state that \"In reality, many Enlightenment intellectuals, even those who were critical of Christianity, were not true atheists. Instead, they were critics of traditional beliefs, aligning more with skepticism, Deism, vitalism, or even pantheism.\" Some supported Pierre Bayle's argument that atheists could still be moral individuals. Others, like Voltaire, believed that a belief in a God who punishes wrongdoing was essential to upholding the moral fabric of society, as atheists have no higher power or laws to fear.",
        "Sleep does not influence the process of learning or recalling information while one is awake. Instead, sleep plays a crucial role in memory consolidation, a process where brain neural connections become stronger. This strengthening enhances the brain's capacity to stabilize and retain memories. Numerous studies have demonstrated that sleep improves memory retention, as memories are fortified through active consolidation. System consolidation occurs during slow-wave sleep (SWS), a period during which memories are reactivated but not every memory undergoes such enhancement. Furthermore, it implies that qualitative changes occur when memories are transferred to long-term storage during sleep. During sleep, the hippocampus replays the events of the day for the neocortex, allowing the neocortex to review and process memories, ultimately moving them into long-term storage. Insufficient sleep can make it challenging to learn as the neural connections are not as robust, leading to a decreased ability to retain information.",
        "Though it may seem that memory functions like a recording device, this is not accurate. The intricate molecular processes governing the formation and persistence of memories are highly dynamic, encompassing multiple stages that span from a few seconds to an entire lifetime. Notably, recent research indicates that memories are not fixed entities but are constructed, with individuals crafting their memories during both encoding and recall. For example, in a famous study by Elizabeth Loftus and John Palmer (1974), participants were shown a film of a traffic accident and then questioned about what they observed. The findings showed that individuals who were asked, \"What was the speed of the cars at the moment of impact?\" provided higher estimates than those who were asked, \"What was the speed of the cars at the instant of collision?\" Moreover, a week later, those who had been asked the question with the word \"smashed\" were almost twice as likely to recall seeing broken glass in the film, compared to those who had not heard the word \"smashed.\"",

Instead, it was inhabited by ethnic groups commonly referred to as the Hundred Yue, encompassing the Dongyue and Ouyue. During the Spring and Autumn Period, the kingdom of Yue surfaced in historical accounts. According to these records, the kingdom of Yue was situated in northern Zhejiang. Shiji reports that its monarchs traced their lineage back to Yu the Great, the founder of the Shang dynasty. Archaeological findings imply that the Baiyue and the kingdom of Yue had a unique culture and history distinct from the kingdoms in northern and central China, whose histories were diligently chronicled during the Spring and Autumn Period and the Qin dynasty. The Song of the Yue Boatman (Chinese: \u8d8a\u4eba\u6b4c, p Yu\u00e8r\u00e9n G\u0113, lit. \"Song of the Yue Man\") is an example of this distinct culture.",
        "Protestantism extended from German territories into France, where it earned the name Huguenots for its followers. Calvin, stationed in Geneva, maintained an ongoing concern for French religious matters. He frequently educated pastors for leading congregations within the nation. Despite severe persecution, the Reformed faith steadily gained ground in many regions, attracting those disillusioned by the Catholic Church's inflexibility and satisfaction. French Protestantism gradually assumed a political dimension, with the 1550s conversions of nobles accentuating this aspect. This paved the way for subsequent religious conflicts, known as the French Religious Wars. The civil wars escalated following Henry II of France's unexpected demise in 1559. Atrocities and outrage became the hallmarks of the era, culminating in the Saint Bartholomew's Day massacre of August 1572, during which Roman Catholics killed an estimated 30,000 to 100,000 Huguenots across France. The wars fostered a climate of unrest and violence.",
        "Unlike other team sports, the National Football League (NFL) preseason follows a precise structure. Every NFL team plays exactly four preseason matches annually, with two held at home and two away, barring two teams each season who play an additional game, known as the Pro Football Hall of Fame Game. These preseason games, typically in August, are primarily organized to help coaches reduce the roster from the off-season maximum of 90 players to the regular-season limit of 53 players. Although preseason scheduling is less rigid compared to the regular season, there are numerous constraints and customs that restrict the choice of preseason opponents, and teams also face limitations on the days and times they can schedule these games. A practice common in sports like baseball and hockey, called split-squad games, involves a team playing two games on the same day by dividing the team into two squads, but this is not a common practice in the NFL preseason.",
        "The 1980s brought economic challenges to Libya. From 1982 to 1986, the country's annual oil revenue plummeted from $21 billion to $5.4 billion. In response, the government initiated irrigation projects, with work commencing on \"Gaddafi's Flagship Project,\" the Great Man-Made River, in 1983. Initially intended for completion by the end of the decade, the project remained unfinished at the dawn of the 21st century. As a result, military expenditures increased, while other administrative budgets were reduced. Beginning in 1980, Libya supported the FROLINAT militia in nearby Chad and, in December of that year, intervened at the request of the Frolinat-controlled GUNT government, aiding in the civil war. In January 1981, Gaddafi proposed a political merger. The Organization of African Unity (OAU) rejected this proposition and demanded a Libyan withdrawal, which occurred in November 1981. However, the civil war resumed, leading to the deployment of Libyan troops once more, resulting in confrontations with French forces backing the southern Chadian forces.",

Intended torchbearers Choi Seung-kook and Park Won-sun opted out of participating in the event as a form of protest against China's actions in Tibet. Over 8,000 riot police were deployed to secure the 24-kilometer route, which started at Olympic Park, which was constructed during Seoul's hosting of the 1988 Summer Games. During the torch relay in Seoul, Chinese students engaged in confrontations with protesters, hurling rocks, bottles, and punches. A North Korean defector, whose sibling defected to China but was later captured and executed by North Korea, attempted to self-immolate as a means of protesting China's treatment of North Korean asylum seekers. He doused himself in gasoline, but police intervened promptly and escorted him away. Two other demonstrators attempted to disrupt the torch relay, but were unsuccessful. Violence erupted at the beginning of the relay between a group of 500 Chinese supporters and an estimated group of protesters.",
        "The ideas of separation proposed by Jefferson and James Madison have been a subject of ongoing debate. While Jefferson declined to issue Proclamations of Thanksgiving sent to him by Congress during his presidency, he did release a Thanksgiving and Prayer proclamation as Governor of Virginia. In contrast, Madison issued four religious proclamations as President but vetoed two bills on the grounds they infringed upon the first amendment. Interestingly, both Jefferson and Madison participated in religious services at the Capitol. Prior to the Constitution's ratification, Madison argued, \"If Religion is exempt from the control of society as a whole, it is even less subject to that of the legislative body.\" After his retirement from the presidency, Madison penned that the United States Constitution upholds \"total separation of church and state.\" Furthermore, Madison emphasized, \"The practical distinction between Religion and Civil Government is strongly protected in the Constitution of the United States.\"",
        "From their initial publication, the works of Virgil dramatically transformed the landscape of Latin poetry. The Eclogues, Georgics, and most notably the Aeneid, were incorporated into scholastic programs, making them mandatory reading for every educated Roman. Later poets frequently drew upon Virgil's works, referencing them intertextually to construct meaning within their own poetry. Augustan poet Ovid humorously imitated the opening lines of the Aeneid in Amores 1.1.1-2, and his retelling of the Aeneas story in Metamorphoses Book 14, commonly known as the \"mini-Aeneid,\" is considered a significant instance of post-Virgilian reaction to the epic genre. Lucan's epic, Bellum Civile, is often labeled as an anti-Virgilian epic, abandoning the divine machinery, focusing on historical events, and deviating significantly from traditional Virgilian epic style. Statius, a Flavian poet, in his 12-book epic Thebaid, closely follows in Virgil's footsteps; in his epilogue, he advises his poem not to compete with the divine Aeneid, but to admire and follow from a distance its path. In Silius Italicus' works, Virgil's influence is unmistakable.",
        "Terry Eastland, in his book From Ending Affirmative Action: The Case for Colorblind Justice, posits that arguments for affirmative action generally fall under two categories: rectifying historical discrimination and fostering diversity. Eastland contends that the initial proponents of affirmative action did not foresee its benefits disproportionately going to the middle-class minority groups who did not require assistance. Furthermore, she asserts that affirmative action can lead to a stigma, causing feelings of self-doubt and a sense of entitlement among minorities. Eastland views affirmative action as a potentially hazardous measure that often fails to deliver the intended results, and she advocates for a more level playing field without it. Economist Thomas Sowell, a proponent of libertarianism, in his book Affirmative Action Around the World: An Empirical Study, highlights what he perceives as the detrimental consequences of affirmative action. According to Sowell, affirmative action policies may prompt non-preferred groups to claim membership in preferred groups [i.e., primary recipients of affirmative action] to reap its benefits.",

Britain, embroiled in a significant war with Napoleon's France, adopted a policy of obstructing American trade with France. The U.S. aimed to maintain neutrality while pursuing overseas commerce. However, Britain disrupted trade and forcibly conscripted sailors from American vessels into the Royal Navy, despite strong objections. Britain also supported a Native American uprising in the American Midwest, with the aim of establishing an Indian state that would impede American expansion. The U.S. declared war on Great Britain in 1812, marking the first time the U.S. had formally declared war. Despite doubts about defeating the Royal Navy, the U.S. opted to attack the British Empire by invading British Canada, hoping to use captured territory as a negotiating tool. The invasion of Canada proved unsuccessful, while simultaneous wars with Native Americans on the western front (Tecumseh's War and the Creek War) were more successful. Following the defeat of Napoleon in 1814, Britain deployed large veteran armies to invade the U.S.",
        "Regarding the distant territories, the Qing dynasty exerted imperial authority, with the emperor assuming the role of Mongol khan, patron of Tibetan Buddhism, and protector of Muslims. However, the Qing's approach shifted with the creation of Xinjiang province in 1884. In the context of the Great Game, leveraging the Dungan uprising in northwest China, Yaqub Beg invaded Xinjiang from Central Asia, backed by the British Empire, and established himself as the ruler of the Kashgaria kingdom. The Qing court dispatched troops to vanquish Yaqub Beg, and Xinjiang was recaptured, subsequently adopting the political system of mainland China. The Kumul Khanate, integrated into the Qing empire as a vassal following its assistance in defeating the Zunghars in 1757, retained its position until the end of the Xinhai Revolution in 1912. In the early 20th century, the British sent an expedition force to Tibet, compelling the Tibetans to submit.",
        "Brigham Young University (BYU) boasts 21 NCAA varsity teams, 19 of which primarily competed in the Mountain West Conference (MWC) from its establishment in 1999 until BYU's departure from the conference in 2011. Prior to joining the MWC, the university's teams were part of the Western Athletic Conference. All teams are identified as the \"Cougars,\" and Cosmo the Cougar has served as the school's mascot since 1953. The school's battle cry is the \"Cougar Fight Song.\" Many of its athletes undergo two-year full-time missions, with men starting at 18 and women at 19. The NCAA allows such missionary service without deducting that period from an athlete's eligibility. This policy has sparked some debate, but is generally perceived as not providing the university with a substantial competitive advantage, as athletes receive minimal athletic and physical training during their missions. BYU has gained notoriety in the sports world for its refusal to participate in games on specific days.",
        "John considered the interdict as akin to a papal declaration of hostilities. His reaction involved aiming to penalize Innocent personally and to create a rift among English clergy potentially supporting him and those aligned with Roman authorities. John confiscated the lands of clergy refusing to perform services, as well as estates associated with Innocent himself; he detained the illicit concubines many clerics maintained during this time, releasing them upon payment of fines; he seized the lands of church members who had left England, and he offered protection for those clergy pledging loyalty to him. Many institutions managed to negotiate their own property management terms and the retention of their estate yields. By 1209, no resolution was in sight, and Innocent threatened to excommunicate John if he did not approve Langton's appointment. When this tactic proved ineffective, Innocent resorted to threatening excommunication.",
        "Greatland China witnessed a convergence of the Japanese 3rd, 6th, and 40th Divisions at Yueyang, who proceeded southward in three columns, crossed the Xinqiang River, and attempted to traverse the Miluo River to reach Changsha. This advance occurred in 1942. However, the Chinese forces scored a victory at Changsha, marking the initial Allied triumph against Japan. The Doolittle Raid's aftermath prompted a significant Japanese military operation, the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Campaign, in which they sought out surviving American airmen, avenged the Chinese who aided them, and destroyed air bases. Launched on May 15, 1942, this operation involved approximately 40 infantry battalions and 15-16 artillery battalions. The Chinese forces thwarted this campaign by the end of September, leaving behind a path of destruction in their wake.",
        "Tech publication CNET awarded the new Super Slim PlayStation 3 4 out of 5 stars (\"Excellent\"), praising it for compacting a potent gaming device into a minuscule form factor while preserving the same features as its predecessors: an extensive gaming catalog and robust streaming services [...]. However, it was criticized for its economical design and disc-loader, as the cover sometimes fails to close properly, giving the impression of using an outdated credit card imprinter machine. This creates a feeling of cheapness. The absence of auto-loading disc trays is also noticed, a feature that is appreciated until it's gone. It seems this design choice was either made to reduce costs or conserve space, but ultimately, it represents a step back. Additionally, the criticism extended to the price, pointing out that the least expensive Super Slim model is pricier than the least expensive Slim model. The smaller size and larger hard drive are not considered significant upgrades, as the hard drive in a Slim model can be effortlessly removed and replaced.",
        "Great edict by Dorgon on July 1645, known as the \"shaving decree,\" compelled adult Han Chinese males to shave the front of their heads, styling the remaining hair into the queue, a hairstyle typically worn by Manchu men. This action was enforced under the threat of execution. The order was famously summarized as: \"Preserve your hair, lose your head; Preserve your head, cut your hair.\" To the Manchus, this measure served as a loyalty test and a means of differentiating allies from adversaries. In contrast, for the Han Chinese, it represented a demeaning symbol of Qing power that contradicted traditional Confucian beliefs. The Xiaojing, a classical text, stated that \"a person's body and hair, being gifts from one's parents, should not be harmed.\" Under the Ming dynasty, adult men kept their hair intact and didn't practice haircutting as they do now.",
        "Border demarcations can be either restrictive or inviting, depending on how they are interpreted by others. A restrictive boundary emerges when an individual employs a symbol that imposes limitations on others' actions. On the contrary, an inviting boundary is formed through the use of a symbol that others find welcoming and are willing to align with. However, it is essential to note that an inviting boundary may also impose limitations on those it embraces by confining their associations within other boundaries. To illustrate, a newcomer who speaks a specific language in a room full of people speaking multiple languages may be perceived as setting a restrictive boundary. While some may understand the language, others may not. Those who don't comprehend it might view the newcomer's language use as merely a neutral representation of identity. Yet, they could also perceive it as a restrictive boundary designed to distinguish them from the newcomer. Conversely, those who understand the language may welcome the newcomer as part of their group.",
        "During the 78 rpm era, numerous manufacturers presented innovative, flexible, or \"unbreakable\" records made from unconventional materials. For instance, Nicole records, crafted from celluloid or a cardboard core coated with a similar substance, were produced in the UK from 1904, yet they were marred by an unusually high level of surface noise. Meanwhile, in the US, Columbia Records launched flexible \"Marconi Velvet Tone Record\" pressings in 1907, but their quieter surfaces and longevity relied on the careful use of gold-plated Marconi Needles, and the product ultimately failed to gain popularity. Thin, plastic records like the German Phonycord and British Filmophone and Goodson records emerged around 1930, but they too did not endure for long. Contemporarily, the French Path\u00e9 Cellodiscs, fashioned from very thin black plastic that bears an eerie resemblance to modern records, also did not enjoy a significant run.",
        "In 1919, post the Treaty of Versailles, Strasbourg was returned to France in accordance with U.S. President Woodrow Wilson's \"Fourteen Points,\" and without a public vote. The formal transfer of ownership was backdated to Armistice Day. It is questionable whether a referendum in Strasbourg would have favored France, given that the parties advocating for Alsatian autonomy or a connection with France represented a minority of votes in both the last Reichstag and the local elections. The pro-French Alsatian autonomists, however, had garnered significant support in the rural areas and other towns since the region's annexation by Germany in 1871. The movement for autonomy began with the first election for the Reichstag, and the elected representatives were known as \"les d\u00e9put\u00e9s protestataires.\" This group remained the sole representatives of the Alsatians in the German parliament until Bismarck's fall in 1890.",
        "The Eastern Roman Empire, as Western Europe underwent the establishment of new kingdoms, persisted unscathed and underwent an economic resurgence lasting into the early 7th century. The eastern part of the empire was less vulnerable to invasions, with most intrusions happening in the Balkans. A prolonged peace with Persia, historically an adversary of Rome, endured for the majority of the 5th century. The Eastern Empire was characterized by a closer alliance between the political power and the Christian Church, with theological matters assuming a significant role in eastern politics that they did not possess in Western Europe. Legal advancements included the consolidation of Roman law; the initial endeavor\u2014the Theodosian Code\u2014was completed in 438. Under Emperor Justinian (527-565), another consolidation transpired\u2014the Corpus Juris Civilis. Justinian also presided over the construction of the Hagia Sophia in Constantinople and the recapture of North Africa from the Vandals and Italy from the Ostrogoths, led by Belisarius (d. 565). The conquest of Italy was not comprehensive, as a lethal plague outbreak in 542 caused Justinian's remaining reign to focus on defensive measures instead.",
        "Upon launching the NES in the US market, Nintendo intentionally deviated from the common design of other gaming consoles to set its product apart from competitors and counteract the negative image game consoles had incurred due to the video game market crash of 1983. To achieve this, they designed the cartridge slot to mimic a front-loading, zero-insertion force (ZIF) cartridge slot, resembling a VCR's front-loading mechanism. This innovative connector functioned effectively when both the connector and cartridges were maintained in clean conditions and the connector's pins were new. However, the ZIF connector was not a genuine zero-insertion force design. When a user inserted a cartridge into the NES, the pressure exerted while pushing the cartridge down and into position caused the contact pins to bend slightly and the cartridge's ROM board to be compressed back into the cartridge itself. Repeated insertion and removal of cartridges over time led to the pins wearing out due to frequent usage, eventually causing issues.",
        "Protestants played a pivotal role in championing religious liberty. Since Luther's refusal to renounce his beliefs at the Diet of Worms (1521), religious freedom gained prominence on theological, philosophical, and political platforms. In Luther's eyes, faith was a spontaneous act of the Holy Spirit, which could not be coerced. The persecuted Anabaptists and Huguenots also advocated for freedom of conscience and church-state separation. In the early 17th century, Baptist leaders such as John Smyth and Thomas Helwys published tracts in support of religious tolerance, influencing the views of John Milton and John Locke. Under the guidance of Baptist Roger Williams, Congregationalist Thomas Hooker, and Quaker William Penn, Rhode Island, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania adopted democratic constitutions that guaranteed religious freedom. These colonies offered refuge to persecuted religious minorities, including Jews, and set the stage for the principles of religious liberty enshrined in the United States Declaration of Independence, the United States Constitution, and the American Bill of Rights.",
        "Birds possess an exceptionally efficient mechanism for transferring oxygen into their bloodstream; they exhibit a tenfold higher surface area to gas exchange ratio compared to mammals. Consequently, birds contain a greater quantity of blood in their capillaries relative to the volume of lung tissue compared to mammals. The arteries feature muscular walls reinforced by elastic tissue to cope with the pressure exerted by ventricular contractions, growing stiffer as they distance themselves from the heart. The blood courses through the arteries, which undergo vasoconstriction, and then proceeds into arterioles that function as a transport network, predominantly supplying oxygen and nutrients to every tissue throughout the body. As the arterioles progress away from the heart and into individual organs and tissues, they are further subdivided to expand surface area and reduce blood flow speed. The blood journeying through the arterioles ultimately enters the capillaries, where gas exchange can transpire. Capillaries are arranged in capillary beds within tissues.",

They have participated in 28 NCAA tournaments, and while they haven't clinched the championship, they have been recognized as national champions by the Helms Athletic Foundation on two occasions. Austin Carr, a former player, holds the record for the most points scored in a single tournament game, with 61. The team has pulled off several upsets against top-ranked opponents, most notably ending UCLA's historic 88-game winning streak in 1974. In addition to that victory, they have defeated eight other number-one teams, earning them the second-highest all-time record against top-ranked opponents, second only to UCLA's 10 wins. The team plays at the renovated Purcell Pavilion, which reopened for the 2009-2010 season within the Edmund P. Joyce Center. Mike Brey, the coach, has been leading the team since the 2004-2005 season.",
        "Greatly reminiscent of the fall of Constantinople in 1453, Pierre Belon, in his work of 1553, noted the employment of pissasphalto, a blend of pitch and bitumen, in Dubrovnik. This material was utilized for the caulking of ships, which were then transported to a marketplace in Venice for sale to the general public. The Mechanics Magazine, in its 1838 edition, reported an early use of asphalt in France. A pamphlet dated 1621, penned by a certain Monsieur d'Eyrinys, disclosed that he had discovered substantial amounts of asphaltum near Neufchatel. He proposed various applications for this substance, including the construction of airtight granaries and the protection of city waterways in Paris from filth using asphalt arches.",
        "Marshall Field & Company was established in 1852 and quickly became the premier department store on State Street in Chicago, the main shopping street in the Midwest. Wealthy shoppers traveled by train from across the region to shop at nearby hotels, and Marshall Field's grew to become a prominent chain. On September 9, 2006, the store transformed into Macy's. Marshall Field's was known for its exceptional customer service and served as a model for other department stores. One of its most famous brands was Frango mints, which became closely associated with Marshall Field's and Chicago. The store was also a pioneer in many ways, with innovations such as the first European buying office in Manchester, England, and the first bridal registry. Marshall Field's was the first to introduce the concept of the personal shopper, offering this service free of charge in every store until its final days.",
        "Some street trams utilized a conduit third-rail system for current collection, with the third rail situated beneath street level. The tram would draw power via a plough inserted through a narrow road slit. In the United States, numerous (but not all) discontinued streetcar systems, such as the one in Washington, D.C. (in 1962), opted for this method to eliminate the aesthetic issues caused by electric traction wires and poles. This approach was also adopted in the former streetcar system of Manhattan. Evidence of this operation style remains on the tracks leading down the northern access to the defunct Kingsway Tramway Subway in central London, UK, where the gap between the running rails is discernible, and on P and Q Streets west of Wisconsin Avenue in the Georgetown neighborhood of Washington, D.C.",
        "According to the 2010 Census, Asian Americans in New York City surpass one million, a figure higher than the combined populations of San Francisco and Los Angeles. New York City holds the highest Asian population among any U.S. city proper. Queens, a borough within New York City, is home to the largest Asian American population in the state and the largest Andean (Colombian, Ecuadorian, Peruvian, and Bolivian) populations in the United States, making it the most ethnically diverse urban area globally. The Chinese population represents the quickest-growing nationality in New York State. Multiple offshoots of the original Manhattan Chinatown (\u7d10\u7d04\u83ef\u57e0), such as Brooklyn's Chinatown (\u5e03\u9c81\u514b\u6797\u83ef\u57e0) and those around Flushing, Queens (\u6cd5\u62c9\u76db\u83ef\u57e0), have flourished as traditional urban enclaves, even as they expand rapidly eastward into suburban Nassau County (\u62ff\u9a37\u7e23) on Long Island (\u9577\u5cf6). The New York metropolitan region and New York State have emerged as the leading destinations for new Chinese immigrants, and large-scale Chinese immigration continues into New York City and surrounding areas. In 2012, approximately 6.3% of New York City residents were of Chinese descent.",
        "In their 2003 paper \"Human Genetic Diversity and the Nonexistence of Biological Races,\" authors Jeffrey Long and Rick Kittles offer a comprehensive critique of the use of FST (Fixation Index) in analyzing human populations. They argue that the commonly cited figure of 85% genetic diversity is misleading since it suggests that all human populations, on average, contain 85% of all human genetic diversity. However, they assert that this figure fails to accurately depict human population history, as it presumes all human groups to be independent. Instead, they propose a more accurate representation of human relationships by recognizing that certain groups are parental to others and that these parental groups constitute paraphyletic groups to their descendant groups. For example, under the recent African origin theory, the African human population is considered paraphyletic, as it serves as the ancestral group from which all non-African populations are derived. However, non-African populations are not descended from a representative sample of the entire African population.",
        "Libya's economic landscape underwent significant transformation through privatization; however, the government asserted that it was promoting \"socialism of the people\" instead of the capitalist ideology, as outlined in The Green Book. Despite rejecting the nationalized industry policies, Libya's leader, Gaddafi, endorsed these reforms, advocating extensive privatization in a speech in March 2003. In 2003, the oil sector was primarily sold to private corporations, leading to a surge in foreign investment, which reached $40 billion by 2004 \u2013 a sixfold increase from 2003. Public protests against these reforms emerged within Libya's population, and in March 2006, hardline revolutionaries seized control of the GPC cabinet, although they slowed down the pace of reforms without halting them. By 2010, plans were revealed to privatize half of Libya's economy over the next decade, though political liberalization was not part of these plans, with Gaddafi continuing to hold significant power. In March 2010, the government granted further powers to municipal councils. Despite the increasing number of protests, the privatization drive continued.",
        "The strategic movements commenced in September 1806. In a significant correspondence to Marshal Soult outlining the strategy for the campaign, Napoleon elucidated the key elements of Napoleonic warfare and introduced the term'square battalion' (le bataillon-carr\u00e9). This system involved the various units of the Grande Arm\u00e9e marching in tight formation, providing close support to one another. If any one unit was assaulted, the others could swiftly respond and offer assistance. With a force of 180,000 soldiers, Napoleon launched an invasion of Prussia, advancing towards the right bank of the River Saale. As in prior campaigns, his main goal was to annihilate a single opponent before reinforcements from another could shift the course of the war. Once informed of the location of the Prussian army, the French shifted westwards and crossed the Saale with an overpowering force. In the twin battles of Jena and Auerstedt, fought on 14 October, the French achieved a decisive victory over their adversaries.",
        "Regarding the timing of Soviet-German reconciliation, numerous historians concur that Maxim Litvinov's dismissal, due to his Jewish ethnicity being regarded negatively by Nazi Germany, eliminated an impediment to discussions with Germany. Stalin promptly instructed Molotov to \"cleanse the ministry of Jews.\" Given Litvinov's earlier efforts to establish an anti-fascist alliance, his affiliation with the policy of collective security with France and Britain, and his pro-Western leanings according to the Kremlin's standards, his removal suggested the presence of a Soviet opportunity for rapprochement with Germany. Simultaneously, Molotov's appointment conveyed to Germany that the USSR was receptive to overtures. This dismissal also indicated to France and Britain the possibility of negotiations with Germany. One British official stated that Litvinov's departure also meant the loss of a skilled technician or buffer, while Molotov's approach was \"more genuinely Bolshevik than diplomatic or cosmopolitan.\" Carr suggested that the Soviet Union's replacement of the Foreign Minister with Molotov signified a shift towards a more German-friendly policy.",
        "Critics widely denounced Gaddafi as tyrannical, cruel, arrogant, self-absorbed, and foolish. Western governments and media portrayed him as the brutal dictator oppressing his own people. The U.S. administration under Reagan labeled him \"Public Enemy No. 1,\" and Reagan himself coined the term \"mad dog of the Middle East.\" Critics argued that people in Libya lived in constant fear under Gaddafi's rule due to the extensive monitoring of civilians by his government. Western analysts often depicted Libya as a totalitarian state. The administration was criticized for its human rights violations; according to Human Rights Watch (HRW) and others, many political prisoners were denied a fair trial, and some were subjected to torture or unlawful execution, most notably in the Abu Salim prison, including an alleged massacre on June 29, 1996, where HRW estimated hundreds were killed.",
        "A predator, by definition, is an organism that obtains its food by killing and consuming other living beings. Unlike other predators that harm their prey in various ways, this type of predator actually kills its victims. Predators may actively pursue their prey, engaging in pursuit predation, or they may patiently wait for their prey to come within striking distance, relying on ambush tactics. Some predators dismantle or chew up large prey before eating it, like a jaguar or a human; others swallow their (typically smaller) prey whole, such as a bottlenose dolphin consuming a fish, or a snake, duck, or stork consuming a frog. Some animals that kill both large and small prey, according to their size (domestic cats and dogs are prime examples), may choose either method depending on the circumstances; they would consume a large insect whole but dismember a rabbit. Some predation methods involve venom that temporarily incapacitates the prey, allowing the predator to consume it without causing immediate death, after which the prey is eventually killed by the toxin.",
        "The Israelites experienced political autonomy twice in ancient times, initially during the eras of the Biblical judges and later with the United Monarchy (under debate). After the demise of the United Monarchy, the region split into Israel and Judah. The term Jew is derived from the Roman \"Judean\" and referred to residents of the southern kingdom of Judah. The switch from \"Israelites\" to \"Jews\" (inhabitants of Judah), though not mentioned in the Torah, is clarified in the Book of Esther (4th century BCE), a text within the Ketuvim, the third section of the Jewish Tanakh. In 587 BC, Nebuchadnezzar II, ruler of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, laid siege to Jerusalem, demolished the First Temple, and exiled the most prominent Jews from Judah. By 586 BC, Judah no longer remained an independent kingdom, and the remaining Jews were rendered homeless. The Babylonian exile concluded in 539 BCE, following the conquest of Babylon by the Achaemenid Empire, and with Cyrus the Great at the helm.",
        "Van Praag posits that the Ming Dynasty's primary motivation for establishing diplomatic ties with Tibet was to obtain horses urgently. Wang and Nyima contest this notion, asserting that these interactions were not diplomatic in nature. Instead, they suggest that Tibetan regions were under the Ming's control, as Tibetan leaders held positions as Ming officials. The horses collected from Tibet were considered a mandatory \"corv\u00e9e\" tax, leading to the argument that Tibetans were handling domestic affairs rather than engaging in foreign diplomacy. Sperling suggests that during this time, the Ming simultaneously purchased horses in the Kham region while battling Tibetan tribes in Amdo and receiving Tibetan delegations in Nanjing. Additionally, he contends that the visits of Tibetan lamas to the Ming court were primarily commercial endeavors aimed at fostering transactions between the lamas' wealthy entourage and Ming Chinese merchants and officials. Kolma\u0161 notes that while the Ming adopted a hands-off policy towards Tibet, they limited the size of Tibetan retinues. However, the Tibetans endeavored to maintain a tributary relationship with the Ming due to imperial patronage.",
        "On November 14, 1908, the Guangxu Emperor passed away, and the following day, Cixi also passed away. It was rumored that either Cixi or Yuan Shikai ordered loyal eunuchs to poison the Guangxu Emperor. An autopsy performed approximately a century later found fatal amounts of arsenic in his remains. Puyi, the oldest son of Zaifeng, Prince Chun, and the childless Guangxu Emperor's nephew, was named successor at just two years old, leaving Zaifeng to serve as regent. This was followed by the removal of General Yuan Shikai from his previous positions of power. In April 1911, Zaifeng established a cabinet, which included two vice-premiers. However, the cabinet was also known as \"The Imperial Cabinet\" due to its membership of thirteen members, five of whom were closely associated with the imperial family.",
        "Bird feathers undergo shedding, which is known as molting. The standard set of feathers a bird grows after molting during the non-breeding season is termed the \"basic\" or \"non-breeding\" plumage. In contrast, the feather changes that occur during the breeding season are referred to as \"alternate\" plumages in the Humphrey-Parkes system. Most species molting annually, but some may undergo two molts a year, and large birds of prey might only molt once every few years. The molting process varies across different species. In passerines, for instance, flight feathers are replaced one at a time, starting with the innermost primary and ending with the outermost tertiaries. After the innermost tertiaries are shed, the secondary feathers, beginning with the innermost, drop until the outer feathers (centrifugal molting) are reached. The greater primary coverts are molted synchronously with the primary feather they overlap. A small number of species, such as some species of birds, undergo unique molting patterns.",
        "Beginning in southeast Europe around the 7th millennium BC, agrarian societies emerged, evidenced by one of Europe's earliest farming sites found in Vasht\u00ebmi, southeastern Albania, dating back to 6,500 BC. Anthropomorphic figurines were discovered in the Balkans as early as 6000 BC, while in Central Europe, they appeared by approximately 5800 BC (La Hoguette). Some of the earliest cultural complexes in this region include the Sesklo culture in Thessaly, which later expanded into the Balkans, giving rise to Star\u010devo-K\u00f6r\u00f6s (Cris), Linearbandkeramik, and Vin\u010da. Through both cultural exchange and migration of peoples, Neolithic traditions moved west and northward, reaching northwestern Europe around 4500 BC. It is possible that the Vin\u010da culture developed the earliest known writing system, the Vin\u010da signs; however, archaeologist Shan Winn suggests that they were more likely pictograms and ideograms rather than a fully-developed writing system.",
        "Multiple reasons have been proposed for Yale's prominence in national elections following the end of the Vietnam War. Several authorities acknowledge the pervasive campus activism that has been present at Yale since the 1960s, as well as the substantial impact of Reverend William Sloane Coffin on numerous prospective candidates. Yale President Richard Levin attributes this trend to the institution's emphasis on cultivating \"a breeding ground for future leaders,\" a strategic goal that was initiated during the presidencies of Yale's Alfred Whitney Griswold and Kingman Brewster. Richard H. Brodhead, former dean of Yale College and current president of Duke University, affirmed: \"We place a considerable emphasis on community engagement in our admissions process, and there is a profound tradition of volunteerism at Yale.\" Yale historian Gaddis Smith highlights an \"ethos of organized engagement\" at Yale throughout the 20th century, which propelled John Kerry to lead the Yale Political Union's Liberal Party, George Pataki the Conservative Party, and Joseph Lieberman to run the Yale Daily News. Camille Paglia emphasizes a historical background.",
        "Among Canadian metropolises, St. John's stands out for its frequent fog (124 days), high wind speeds (average of 24.3 km/h or 15.1 mph), and low sunshine hours (1,497 hours). St. John's is known for its milder winter temperatures compared to other Canadian cities, boasting the mildest winter of any city outside British Columbia. Rainfall occurs frequently, often heavily, throughout the year. Typically, summer is the least rainy season, with infrequent thunderstorms, while the wettest months are from October to January, with December being the wettest individual month, averaging 165 millimeters of precipitation. This winter precipitation peak is unusual for humid continental climates, which usually experience a late spring or early summer precipitation maximum.",
        "France: The Paris leg of the torch relay, which took place on April 7, commenced on the ground level of the Eiffel Tower and concluded at the Stade Charl\u00e9ty. Originally, the route was intended to span 28 km, but it was reduced in length due to pressure from Chinese officials, following numerous demonstrations by pro-Tibet and human rights activists who sought to disrupt, obstruct, or halt the event. A planned ceremony at the town hall was cancelled at the behest of the Chinese authorities, and, similarly, at the request of Chinese officials, the torch completed the relay by bus instead of being carried by athletes. The city authorities of Paris had declared their intention to welcome the Olympic flame with peaceful protests upon its arrival in the capital. The city administration decided to display a banner stating \"Paris stands for human rights everywhere.\"",
        "Green is predominantly linked with nature, life, health, youth, spring, and hope in surveys conducted across Europe and the United States. However, it can also symbolize death, sickness, or the devil in these regions (green carries several seemingly paradoxical associations). Conversely, in China, it is a very positive symbol, representing fertility and happiness. During the Middle Ages and Renaissance, green was worn by merchants, bankers, and the gentry, while red was the color of the nobility, signifying their status. In art, the Mona Lisa, created by Leonardo da Vinci, wears green to signify that she is not of noble birth. Similarly, in the British House of Commons, the benches are green, while those in the House of Lords are red. Green is also traditionally associated with safety and permission; a green light signals to proceed, and a green card grants permanent residency.",
        "The period witnessed Libya reemerging on the global stage. In 1999, Libya initiated confidential negotiations with the British administration to establish normal diplomatic ties. In 2001, Gaddafi publicly denounced the September 11 attacks on the U.S. by al-Qaeda, expressing condolences to the victims and advocating for Libyan participation in the fight against militant Islamism as part of the War on Terror. Concurrently, the Libyan government continued to quell domestic Islamist movements. At the same time, Gaddafi spoke in favor of expanding the use of sharia law. Libya strengthened ties with China and North Korea, with Chinese President Jiang Zemin visiting Libya in April 2002. In response to the events of the Iraq War, in December 2003, Libya relinquished its claim to weapons of mass destruction, dismantling its chemical and nuclear weapons programs. This move improved relations with the U.S., resulting in a meeting between Gaddafi and UK Prime Minister Tony Blair in the Libyan desert in March 2004. The following month, Gaddafi visited the European Union (EU) headquarters in Brussels, symbolizing improved relations.",
        "In 356, Constantius banished Liberius, granting him only three days to comply. His destination was Beroea, a city in Thrace; specifically, Beroea, Thrace. Constantius presented lavish gifts if Liberius would adopt the Arian belief, but Liberius declined. The emperor even offered Liberius 500 gold pieces to cover his expenses, but Liberius refused them, stating he would rather distribute them among his flatterers. The empress also sent a similar gift, asking the messenger to embrace Christianity and cease his persecution of the Church. However, Liberius rejected the gift. An attempt was made to leave the presents in the Church, but Liberius discarded them. In response, Constantius ordered Liberius, under heavy guard, to Milan. During a recorded conversation by Theodoret, Liberius courageously informed Constantius that Athanasius had been declared innocent at Sardica, and his accusers were found to be slanderers (referred to as \"calumny\") and fraudsters. He also argued that it was unjust to continue targeting the Church of God.",
        "In February 2004, Roc-A-Fella Records released The College Dropout, with Kanye West's debut single, \"Through the Wire,\" hitting number fifteen on the Billboard Hot 100 for five consecutive weeks. Subsequently, his second single \"Slow Jamz,\" featuring Twista and Jamie Foxx, outperformed its predecessor, becoming the first number one hit for all three artists. The album received widespread critical acclaim, being crowned as the top album of the year by two prominent music publications, and has consistently been recognized as one of the best hip-hop works and debut albums by artists. The fourth single from the album, \"Jesus Walks,\" possibly expanded West's audience, as its theme revolved around faith and Christianity. Despite initial doubts by industry executives about the commercial viability of a song with such overt expressions of faith, it managed to enter the top 20 of the Billboard pop charts.",
        "The Montana Territory was established on April 26, 1864, following the passage of the Organic Act. Prior to its formal inception, families had already begun settling in the area, leading to the formation of early schools. These initial schools were subscription schools, often held in the teacher's residence. The first documented school was located at Fort Owen in the Bitterroot Valley, established in 1862. This school primarily educated indigenous children and children of Fort Owen employees. The first school term commenced in early winter and concluded on February 28, under the tutelage of Mr. Robinson. Another early subscription school was inaugurated by Thomas Dimsdale in Virginia City in 1863, charging students $1.75 per week. The Montana Territorial Legislative Assembly convened for the first time in 1864. This first legislature empowered counties to impose taxes for educational purposes, thereby laying the groundwork for the establishment of public schools. \u2800",
        "The crucial last component of identity development is self-worth. Self-worth is understood as an individual's perceptions and emotions concerning their self-image and identity. Most theories on self-worth indicate a widespread ambition, encompassing all genders and age groups, to uphold, safeguard, and boost their self-worth. Contrary to common assumption, there is no substantial research evidence suggesting a notable decline in self-worth during adolescence. \"Barometric self-worth\" may experience rapid fluctuations and lead to extreme emotional distress and anxiety, but the fundamental level of self-worth remains consistently stable during adolescence. The reliability of broad self-worth assessment tools has been debated, and some suggest that more targeted scales could offer a deeper understanding of the adolescent experience. Females tend to experience higher self-worth when participating in supportive relationships with friends, the primary role of friendship for them being a source of social and ethical support. When they, specifically, are involved in such relationships, they flourish.",
        "The historical racial makeup of Bermuda's population has been largely concealed due to the ethnic homogenization of the past four centuries. In essence, there is little ethnic variation between black and white Bermudians, beyond that found in more recent immigrant communities. However, this was not the case in the 17th century. For the initial hundred years of settlement, white Protestants of English descent were the dominant group, with smaller numbers of Irish (many of whom likely spoke Gaelic) and Scots being sent to Bermuda following the English invasions of their homelands following the English Civil War. Non-white minorities at that time included Spanish-speaking, free (indentured) blacks from the West Indies, black chattel slaves primarily captured from Spanish and Portuguese ships by Bermudian privateers, Native Americans, primarily from Algonquian and other tribes of the Atlantic seaboard, but potentially from as far as Mexico. By the 19th century, white Bermudians of English ethnicity had lost their numerical superiority. Despite this, the population's racial makeup has become more homogeneous over time.",
        "Intel had been unsuccessful in convincing Apple to switch the Macintosh system to Intel microprocessors. Apple determined that Intel's CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer) architecture would not be able to match the efficiency of RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) processors. The Motorola 68040 provided the same features as the Intel 80486 and could even outperform the Intel chip in clock-for-clock comparisons. However, the 80486 was capable of operating at significantly higher speeds without overheating issues, especially the i486DX2, which doubled the external bus speed and boosted the CPU logic. This gave IBM-compatible systems a substantial performance edge over their Macintosh counterparts. Additionally, Apple's product design and engineering policies limited the use of the '040 to their high-end Quadras for some time, while the 486 was readily available to OEMs and enthusiasts for self-assembly. By the end of 1991, as the high-end Macintosh desktop lineup moved to the '040, Apple struggled to keep pace with the availability of the 486.",
        "In the 1970s and 1980s, several hard rock bands maintained flourishing recording careers. Bon Jovi scored a commercial success with \"It's My Life\" from their double platinum-selling album Crush (2000). AC/DC released the platinum-certified Stiff Upper Lip (2000), while Aerosmith put out a platinum-selling number two album, Just Push Play (2001), which ventured deeper into pop with the Top 10 hit \"Jaded.\" They also released a blues cover album, Honkin' on Bobo, which peaked at number five in 2004.

        "To avoid the danger of uncoordinated power supplies merging, sections of the line drawing power from distinct feeder stations must be meticulously segregated. This segregation is achieved through Neutral Sections (also known as Phase Disconnects), which are usually found at feeder stations and at midpoints between them. Typically, only half of these Neutral Sections are in use at any given time, with the remaining sections serving as backup to allow a feeder station to be shut down and power supplied from neighboring feeder stations. Neutral Sections typically consist of an earthed section of wire that is insulated from the live wires on either side using insulating material such as ceramic beads. The design allows for a smooth transition of the pantograph from one section to the other. The earthed section safeguards against an arc being drawn from one live section to another, as the voltage difference may be greater than the standard system voltage when the live sections belong to different phases. If the protective circuit breakers cannot safely interrupt the substantial current that would flow as a result, the earthed section prevents it. To prevent potential power disruptions during the switching of feeder stations, only half of the Neutral Sections are usually in operation. The remaining sections serve as a backup, ensuring power continuity from nearby feeder stations.",
        "The creation of Carolingian art was centered on a select group at the court, along with the monasteries and churches they patronized. The dominant theme was an attempt to revive the grandeur and classicism of imperial Roman and Byzantine art. However, it was also impacted by Insular art of the British Isles. This art form combined the vitality of Irish Celtic and Anglo-Saxon Germanic decorative styles with Mediterranean motifs such as the book. It set the foundation for many characteristics of art throughout the medieval era. The surviving religious pieces from the Early Middle Ages primarily consist of illuminated manuscripts and carved ivories, initially produced for metalwork that has since been recycled. Artwork in precious metals held the highest status, but most of these pieces have been lost, with only a few crosses like the Cross of Lothair, several reliquaries, and finds such as the Anglo-Saxon burial at Sutton Hoo and the Gourdon hoards from Merovingian France, Guarrazar from Visigothic Spain, and Nagyszentmikl\u00f3s near Byzantine territory remaining.",
        "Cultivating cotton effectively demands a lengthy frost-free span, ample sunlight, and a moderate precipitation, typically ranging from 600 to 1,200 mm (24 to 47 inches). Generally, the soil should be relatively heavy, although the nutrient content does not need to be particularly high. In general, these conditions are found within the seasonally dry tropics and subtropics in both the Northern and Southern hemispheres. However, a significant amount of the cotton produced today is grown in regions with less rainfall that rely on irrigation. The cultivation of the crop for a specific year usually begins shortly after the harvest of the previous autumn. Cotton is a perennial by nature but is grown as an annual to manage pests. Spring planting in the Northern hemisphere takes place between February's beginning and June's. The US region referred to as the South Plains is one such area where cotton is grown. In the United States, the South Plains region is where cotton is primarily cultivated.",
        "The literary work witnessed numerous translations during Darwin's era, however, issues arose concerning the interpretation of complex ideas and metaphors, and certain translations were influenced by the translator's personal agenda. Darwin distributed complimentary copies in France and Germany, anticipating prospective translators to handle arrangements with local publishers. He acknowledged the eminent elder naturalist and geologist Heinrich Georg Bronn, yet the German edition published in 1860 integrated Bronn's personal viewpoints, introducing debatable themes that Darwin had intentionally excluded. Bronn rendered \"favoured races\" as \"advanced races,\" and included essays on various topics such as the origin of life, as well as a concluding chapter with religious implications partly influenced by Bronn's affiliation with Naturphilosophie. In 1862, Bronn released a second edition based on the third English edition and Darwin's proposed adjustments, but later succumbed to a heart attack. Darwin maintained regular correspondence with Julius Victor Carus, who published a revised translation in 1867. Darwin's work underwent further improvements in translation during 1867 under the guidance of Carus.",

They encountered formidable opposition from the Dukes of Normandy, who, under William the Conqueror (ruled 1035\u20131087), conquered England in 1066, creating a cross-channel empire that persisted in diverse forms throughout the rest of the Middle Ages. Moreover, Normans established settlements in Sicily and southern Italy following Robert Guiscard's (died 1085) landing there in 1059, which led to the formation of a duchy that eventually transformed into the Kingdom of Sicily. Under the Angevin dynasty, particularly Henry II (ruled 1154\u201389) and his son Richard I (ruled 1189\u201399), the English monarchy governed both England and significant parts of France, acquiring these territories under Henry II's rule.",

Although it wasn't the highest-selling console of the seventh generation, TechRadar deemed it as the most impactful, due to its emphasis on digital media distribution, online gaming through Xbox Live, and the popularization of game achievement awards. PC Magazine viewed the Xbox 360 as the blueprint for online gaming, as it demonstrated that online gaming communities could flourish within the console realm. Five years after its initial launch, the highly-acclaimed Kinect motion capture device was unveiled, setting a record as the swiftest-selling consumer electronic device in history and prolonging the console's lifespan.

In Scandinavia, Vladimir received support from his relative, Earl H\u00e5kon Sigurdsson, the ruler of Norway, and united a Viking force to reclaim Novgorod and Kiev from Yaropolk. Upon assuming the position of Prince of Kiev, Vladimir's significant accomplishment was the Christianization of Kievan Rus'.

        "During that war, Galicia managed to avoid the most intense fighting: it was among the regions where the initial rebellion at the war's onset was successful, and it remained under Nationalist (Franco's army's) control throughout the conflict. Despite the absence of major battles, there were instances of repression and death: all political parties were disbanded, along with labor unions and Galician nationalist groups like the Seminario de Estudos Galegos. Galicia's autonomy statute was nullified, much like those of Catalonia and the Basque provinces once they were captured. According to Carlos Fern\u00e1ndez Santander, at least 4,200 individuals met their deaths either extrajudicially or following swift trials, including republicans, communists, Galician nationalists, socialists, and anarchists.

        "Most fatty acids are non-essential, as the body can synthesize them using other fatty acids and energy. However, there are two essential fatty acids in humans that must be obtained through diet. A balanced intake of essential fatty acids, specifically omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, appears crucial for health, although conclusive evidence is hard to come by. Both omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids are precursors for a type of hormone-like compounds called prostaglandins, which play various roles within the body. Omega-3 eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), either produced in the body from alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), an essential omega-3 fatty acid, or consumed through marine sources, is a key component for series 3 prostaglandins (such as inflammatory PGE3). Omega-6 dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA) acts as a building block for series 1 prostaglandins.",
        "Religious leaders, known as public priests, were chosen by the collegia. Once chosen, a priest wielded perpetual religious power, granted by the divine, which provided them with enduring influence, privileges, and immunity throughout their lifetime. This power was subject to civil and religious laws that restricted the number and type of religious positions that an individual or their family could hold. The religious law, being collegial and steeped in tradition, played a significant role in shaping political decisions, had the power to reverse them, and was challenging to manipulate for personal benefits. The priesthood was a prestigious, yet financially burdensome title. According to traditional Roman practice, a priest received no salary. Donations made to the cult were considered the property of the deity, requiring the priest to provide the necessary cult activities, even when there were shortfalls in public funding. This could result in the priest personally covering the expenses for acolytes and all other cult-related maintenance. For those who had completed the Cursus honorum, a lifelong career in military or political life, permanent priesthood was often sought or granted after a lifetime of service; ideally, they had excelled in both spheres:  \u200b",

        "During his work on his significant book about Natural Selection, Darwin received a package on June 18, 1858, from Wallace, who resided on the Maluku Islands (Ternate and Gilolo). Inside the package were twenty pages detailing an evolutionary process, a response to Darwin's recent encouragement, with a suggestion to forward it to Lyell if Darwin considered it valuable. The process shared similarities with Darwin's own theory. Darwin wrote to Lyell, expressing his astonishment by saying, \"your words have proved to be exceedingly prophetic,... preempted,\" and he would \"immediately write and propose to submit [it] to any journal\" that Wallace selected. Darwin's originality, as he saw it, would be challenged. Lyell and Hooker decided that a joint publication comprising Wallace's pages, excerpts from Darwin's 1844 Essay, and his 1857 letter to Gray, should be presented at the Linnean Society. Consequently, on July 1, 1858, the papers titled \"On the Tendency\" were submitted.",

        "Many contemporary special matches have been created, each with distinct victory criteria. The most prevalent of these is the ladder match. In this fundamental version, combatants, either individual wrestlers or teams, compete to ascend a ladder to retrieve a prize suspended above the ring. The primary objective is to render opponents incapacitated for a significant enough duration, allowing a single wrestler or team to climb the ladder and capture the prize for their group. This struggle often leads to the ladder being utilized as a weapon. The prizes can consist of \u2013 but are not restricted to \u2013 any championship belt (the usual prize), a document granting the victor a future title opportunity, or any document of importance to the wrestlers participating in the bout (such as one providing a cash prize).

However, he was defeated in 288 BC when Lysimachus of Thrace and Pyrrhus of Epirus jointly invaded Macedon from two directions, promptly dividing the kingdom among themselves. Demetrius retreated to central Greece with his mercenaries, garnering support there and in the northern Peloponnese. Subsequently, he besieged Athens when they rebelled, but later negotiated a treaty with the Athenians and Ptolemy, enabling him to move to Asia minor and wage war on Lysimachus' possessions in Ionia.

        "The pioneering work that conveyed scientific concepts and insights in a manner accessible to the general public, in their native languages, and with reader enjoyment in mind, was Bernard de Fontenelle's \"Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds\" (1686). The book was tailored for women enthusiastic about scientific literature and sparked numerous similar publications. These popular works were characterized by a conversational writing style, making the complex subject matter more digestible for readers than the academic articles, discourses, and books traditionally published by scholars and institutions. Charles Leadbetter's \"Astronomy\" (1727) was marketed as a \"New Work\" that would offer \"Brief and Easy Rules and Astronomical Tables.\" The initial French exposition of Newtonianism and the \"Principia\" was \"Elements of Newton's Philosophy,\" published by Voltaire in 1738. Emilie du Ch\u00e2telet's translation of the \"Principia,\" published posthumously in 1756, contributed to the broader dissemination of Newton's ideas beyond academic circles and universities. Francesco Algarotti, on the other hand, also played a role in spreading Newton's theories through his work \"Newtonianism for the Ladies\" (1737).",
        "In 633 AD, Arab armies led by the Rashidun Caliphate overtook Iran, and by 651 AD, the region had been conquered. The majority of the population, who previously followed Manichaeism and Zoroastrianism, were largely converted to Sunni Islam. Although Arabic became the official language, Persian continued to be used both in everyday life and in literature. Iran played a significant role during the Islamic Golden Age, with numerous scientists, scholars, artists, and thinkers emerging from the region. The Safavid Dynasty, established in 1501, saw the conversion of Iranians from Sunni Islam to Twelver Shia Islam, making it the official religion of the country. This transition marked a significant turning point in Iranian and Muslim history. From 1736 onwards, under the rule of Nader Shah, Iran reached its greatest territorial expanse since the Sassanid Empire, boasting a formidable empire. However, during the 19th century, Iran lost large portions of its territories in the Caucasus to Imperial Russia, a loss that significantly altered the concept of Iran for centuries.

        "A 2002 government report, as reported by The Guardian, uncovered that from 1940 to 1979, the Ministry of Defense converted extensive parts of the nation into a covert testing ground for germ warfare experiments on the public. These tests reportedly involved disseminating potentially hazardous substances and microorganisms across vast areas of the populace without prior notification. The Ministry of Defense maintains that these experiments were meant to replicate germ warfare scenarios and that they posed no harm. However, families residing near several testing sites have documented higher rates of birth defects and disabilities among their children, prompting demands for a public investigation. The report alleges that these tests potentially affected millions, including a significant stretch from 1961 to 1968 along the south coast of England, where over a million individuals, from Torquay to the New Forest, were exposed to pathogens like e.coli and bacillus globigii, a bacteria similar to anthrax.",
        "The early 1980s marked significant shifts in personnel and musical direction among established hard rock bands. For instance, the lead vocalist of AC/DC, Bon Scott, and the drummer of Led Zeppelin, John Bonham, both passed away during this period. While the latter's band disbanded shortly after, AC/DC carried on with the addition of Brian Johnson as their new lead singer, resulting in the release of the highly successful album, Back in Black (1980), which ranks fifth on the list of best-selling albums in the US and second worldwide. In a similar vein, Black Sabbath parted ways with their original vocalist, Ozzy Osbourne, in 1979, and recruited Ronnie James Dio, previously of Rainbow, to replace him. This change brought about a new sound and a wave of creativity and popularity for the band, beginning with Heaven and Hell (1980). Concurrently, Ozzy Osbourne commenced his solo career with Blizzard of Ozz (1980), featuring guitarist Randy Rhoads. Meanwhile, some bands, like Queen, drifted away from their hard rock foundation and towards a pop rock sound, while others, including unspecified ones, remained committed to the genre.",
        "Based on sketches of a few particles interacting within spacetime, Feynman devised a framework to describe the entire realm of physics in terms of the spins of these particles and the reach of fundamental force interactions. Feynman proposed the parton model as an explanation for the strong interactions governing nucleon scattering. This model served as a supplement to the quark model, a theory developed by Feynman's Caltech colleague, Murray Gell-Mann. The connection between the two models remained vague; Gell-Mann sarcastically dismissed Feynman's partons as \"fabrications\". In the mid-1960s, physicists viewed quarks as merely a tool for symmetry calculations, rather than actual particles, due to the implausible statistics of the Omega-minus particle, if interpreted as three identical strange quarks bound together. The deep inelastic scattering experiments conducted at Stanford's linear accelerator in the late 1960s, similar to Rutherford's alpha particle scattering on gold nuclei experiment, revealed that quarks might indeed be real particles.",

Ancient civilizations such as the Egyptians and Greeks employed select mold, plant materials, and extracts to combat infections. The lab discovery of antibiosis, the competition between microorganisms, later revealed natural antibacterial compounds produced by these organisms. Pasteur insightfully noted, \"if we could manipulate the competition observed among certain bacteria, it could potentially revolutionize therapy.\" Jean Paul Vuillemin, a French bacteriologist, coined the term 'antibiosis,' which translates to 'against life,' to describe this phenomenon displayed by early antibacterial agents.

This trend is consistent in Germany, at both national and state levels, as well as in most communal constituencies. In the Republic of Iceland, since its founding, there has never been a government led by a single party; instead, coalitions (usually comprising the Independence Party and one other, often the Social Democratic Alliance) have taken charge. A similar scenario is observed in the Republic of Ireland, as no party has held power independently since 1989. Instead, a series of coalition governments, primarily led by Fianna F\u00e1il or Fine Gael, have been established.

        "Great Britain, however, remained as an independent Kingdom of Scotland until 1603. When the Scottish King inherited the English and Irish crowns, the kingdom's independence ended. The 17th century was marked by political turmoil, religious strife, and war. The colonial expansion of England in Ireland during the 16th century was intensified by the establishment of extensive Scottish and English colonies in Ulster. Religious tensions escalated, and the monarch in England clashed with parliament over his lenient stance towards Catholicism. A significant issue was this tolerance policy. The ensuing English Civil War, also known as the War of the Three Kingdoms, resulted in a revolutionary republic in England. Ireland, predominantly Catholic, generally supported the king. After a defeat against the parliament's army, significant land redistributions took place, distributing property from loyalist Irish nobility to English commoners serving the parliamentary army.

The Marathas continued their military ventures against the Mughals, Nizam, Nawab of Bengal, and the Durrani Empire to expand their territories. Gordon detailed the strategic manner in which the Marathas seized control over newly acquired regions. They initially implemented annual raids, extracted ransom from villages and towns, while the weakened Mughal Empire still held nominal power, and eventually took over the region. He illustrated this process with the example of the Malwa region. The Marathas developed a robust system of public administration, renowned for its meticulousness. This system proved effective in generating revenue from districts that had recovered from prolonged raids, reaching levels comparable to those experienced prior to the raids.",
        "In 1939, the Bureau commenced the creation of a detention list for custodial arrest, containing names of individuals who would be detained in case of war with Axis powers. The bulk of the names on this list were from the Issei community leaders, as the FBI's investigation expanded upon an existing Naval Intelligence index that targeted Japanese Americans in Hawaii and on the West Coast. However, numerous German and Italian nationals were also added to the clandestine list. On December 7, 1941, the head of the Honolulu office, Robert Shivers, received approval from Hoover to detain individuals on the list, while bombs were still falling over Pearl Harbor. Shortly after the attack, mass arrests and unauthorized searches of homes started, and within a few hours, over 5,500 Issei men were taken into FBI custody. On February 19, 1942, President Franklin Roosevelt issued Executive Order 9066, which authorized the relocation of Japanese Americans from the West Coast. FBI Director Hoover was against this order.",
        "The capacity of the body to respond to antigens varies based on factors such as age, antigen type, maternal influences, and the site of antigen exposure. Newborns often experience a state of physiological immunodeficiency due to a significant suppression of both their innate and adaptive immune responses. Following birth, a child's immune system shows preference towards protein antigens but reacts less effectively to glycoproteins and polysaccharides. The infections that commonly afflict neonates are often caused by low-virulence organisms like Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas. In neonates, the opsonic activity and the ability to activate the complement cascade are markedly limited. Specifically, the average level of C3 in a newborn is roughly 65% of that found in adults. Phagocytic activity in newborns is also significantly impaired. This is due to lower opsonic activity, as well as reduced up-regulation of integrin and selectin receptors, which limits the ability of neutrophils to engage with adhesion molecules in the endothelium.",
        "Beginning with independence, the Chief Commissioner's Province of Himachal Pradesh was established on 15 April 1948, following the amalgamation of 28 small princely states, including rulers and zaildars, in the western Himalayan regions, commonly known as the Simla Hills States, and four southern hill states of Punjab. This union was effected through the Himachal Pradesh (Administration) Order of 1948, executed under Sections 3 and 4 of the Extra-Provincial Jurisdiction Act of 1947 (renamed the Foreign Jurisdiction Act of 1947 by the Order of 1950). The State of Bilaspur was incorporated into Himachal Pradesh on 1 April 1954, as per the Himachal Pradesh and Bilaspur (New State) Act of 1954. Himachal Pradesh became a part C state on 26 January 1950, with the enactment of the Indian Constitution.",
        "The moniker \"Bleacher Bums\" identifies a group of enthusiastic spectators, known for their constant banter throughout the day, who occupy the bleacher seats at Wrigley Field. Originally, these fans were labeled \"bums\" due to their frequent attendance at games, which were predominantly day games, leading to the assumption they were unemployed. Notably, many of these fans were, and continue to be, students from universities in the Chicago area, such as DePaul University, Loyola, Northwestern University, and the University of Illinois at Chicago. A long-running Broadway production, featuring Joe Mantegna, Dennis Farina, Dennis Franz, and James Belushi, was inspired by their experiences and played for years.",
        "Approximately 1:17 pm PDT (20:17 UTC), the torch was ignited in a public park near AT&T Park. It was momentarily raised by representatives from both American and Chinese Olympic committees. The relay, however, became chaotic when the first runner vanished into a warehouse on a waterfront pier. This unexpected detour resulted in a 30-minute delay. Conflicts arose between pro-China protesters, who were allegedly transported by the Chinese Consulate and other pro-China groups, and demonstrators supporting Tibet and Darfur. The non-Chinese protesters were reported to have been surrounded and followed by irate crowds. At approximately 2 pm PDT (21:00 UTC), the torch reappeared approximately 3 kilometers (1.9 miles) away from the stadium on Van Ness Avenue, an area not included in the official route plans. Television broadcasts showed the flame burning on this unplanned route.",
        "A conventional adult soccer game features two segments, 45 minutes long each, named halves. These halves proceed uninterrupted, implying the game clock doesn't halt when the ball leaves the play area. A typical intermission of 15 minutes takes place between halves. The game's conclusion is termed full-time. The match referee acts as the official timekeeper, and they can extend the time due to player substitutions, injured players, or other delays. This extended time is often called additional time in FIFA documents, but it's commonly known as stoppage time or injury time, and loss time can be used interchangeably. The referee decides the length of stoppage time at their discretion. The referee signals the game's end, and as the game nears its end, they signal the amount of added time to the fourth official, if appointed. The fourth official then informs the players and spectators by displaying the time on a board.",
        "Identification of an infectious agent is typically warranted only when it serves to improve disease treatment or prevention, or to enhance understanding of a disease's progression before effective therapeutic or preventive strategies are available. For instance, in the early 1980s, prior to the emergence of AZT as a treatment for AIDS, the progression of the disease was extensively tracked through regular blood sample analysis, as these findings would not offer additional treatment options to the patient. However, such studies facilitated the formation of theories regarding HIV's spread within specific communities, which in turn paved the way for targeted strategies to minimize new infections. Moreover, the serological, and subsequently genotypic or molecular, identification of HIV facilitated the development of hypotheses about the disease's temporal and geographical origins. In summary, the identification of infectious agents is crucial for disease treatment, prevention, and understanding their progression. This knowledge can help guide resources and strategies towards high-risk communities, as demonstrated in the early AIDS epidemic.",
        "since regaining sovereignty, Estonia has positioned itself as a bridge between Eastern and Western markets and has proactively implemented economic reforms to align with the West. Following market reforms, Estonia emerged as an economic front-runner in the former COMECON region.[citation needed] In 1994, Estonia adopted a flat tax rate of 26%, based on the economic principles of Milton Friedman, making it one of the first countries to implement such a tax structure. The personal income tax rate was lowered to 24% in 1994, and subsequently reduced to 23% in 2006, 21% in 2008, and 20% in 2016. Estonia joined the eurozone on January 1, 2011, a move that was delayed due to persistent high inflation. A Land Value Tax is imposed to fund local municipalities, with all revenue directed towards Local Councils. Although it is a state-level tax, it functions primarily at the local government level.",
        "The isle of Saint Helena encompasses 122 km\u00b2 (47 sq mi), predominantly consisting of volcanic terrain, with the latest volcanic activity estimated to have occurred approximately 7 million years ago. The coastline is dominated by volcanic rock, and presents a warmer and drier climate compared to the island's central region. The highest elevation on the island is Diana's Peak, standing at 818 m (2,684 ft). In 1996, it was designated as the island's first national park. The majority of the island is covered by New Zealand flax, remnants of a previous industry, but there are also original trees and plantations, including those of the Millennium Forest project, which began in 2002 to reforest parts of the lost Great Wood and is now managed by the Saint Helena National Trust. Upon its discovery, the island was blanketed in unique indigenous vegetation, such as a distinct cabbage tree species. It is presumed that the island's interior once boasted a dense tropical forest, while the coastal areas may have been equally lush.",
        "In the mid-80s, popular bands staged a resurgence. Following an 8-year hiatus, Deep Purple regrouped with their iconic Machine Head lineup to release Perfect Strangers (1984). This album reached the fifth spot in the UK charts, climbed into the top five in five other countries, and achieved platinum status in the US. Van Halen, after experiencing sluggish sales with their fourth album, Fair Warning, saw a comeback with the Top 3 album Diver Down (1982). They reached their commercial peak with their subsequent release in 1984, which soared to the second position on the Billboard album chart and included the hit single \"Jump,\" which spent several weeks at the top of the singles chart. Heart, struggling during the first half of the decade, made a comeback with their self-titled ninth studio album, which topped the charts and produced four Top 10 singles, including their first number 1 hit.",
        "American politics have largely been dominated by a two-party system, with the conservative Republican Party and the liberal Democratic Party being the norm. Initially, these parties were known as Federalists and Republicans, followed by a phase of Republican rule before a divide emerged between National Republicans and Democratic Republicans. The former evolved into the Whig Party, while the latter became the Democratic Party. The Whig Party persisted for just two decades before it disintegrated over the issue of slavery expansion, with opponents forming the new Republican Party and anti-slavery Democrats joining them. Third-party contenders (like the Libertarian Party) typically receive scant support and rarely win elections. However, there have been instances where third parties have drawn votes from the anticipated winners, such as Theodore Roosevelt in the 1912 election and George Wallace in the 1968 election.",
        "The sports affiliations for Notre Dame, with the exception of football and fencing, underwent a change in July 2013 due to significant conference realignment, while the fencing affiliation will change in July 2014. The Irish departed from the Big East to join the ACC during a time of instability within the Big East. Although they maintained their independence in football, they agreed to play five games against ACC opponents each season. The decision by the Big Ten Conference to add ice hockey in 2013-14 triggered a series of moves that resulted in the disbandment of Notre Dame's former hockey conference, the Central Collegiate Hockey Association, following the 2012-13 season. The hockey team was relocated to Hockey East. Upon joining the ACC, the conference announced its intention to sponsor fencing beginning with the 2014-15 academic year. Although the origin of the athletic nickname \"Fighting Irish\" is debated, it is known that the name was adopted.",
        "Eighty torch-bearers were chosen for the London event, and the first, Sir Steve Redgrave, expressed concerns to the media about receiving emails urging a boycott. He acknowledged understanding the motivations behind these requests. Francesca Martinez and Richard Vaughan declined to participate, while Konnie Huq accepted the torch and used the opportunity to express opposition towards China. Norman Baker, a pro-Tibetan Member of Parliament, urged all torch-bearers to reconsider. Amidst pressure from various sides, Prime Minister Gordon Brown welcomed the torch outside 10 Downing Street without physically interacting with it. The London relay was accompanied by what the BBC described as a \"mobile protective barrier.\" Protests started as soon as Redgrave initiated the event, leading to approximately thirty-five arrests. In Ladbroke Grove, a demonstrator attempted to seize the torch from Konnie Huq in a brief scuffle, and in a separate incident, a fire extinguisher was activated near the torch. The Chinese ambassador carried the torch through Chinatown following the event.",
        "Jerusalem, a city of significance, holds great religious importance for Jews, Muslims, and Christians. It is the dwelling place of significant sites that are central to their faiths, such as the Old City encompassing the Western Wall and Temple Mount, the Al-Aqsa Mosque, and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. Nazareth, renowned as the location of the Annunciation of Mary in Christianity, is another site of religious importance in Israel. Tiberias and Safed, being two of the Four Holy Cities in Judaism, also hold religious significance. The White Mosque in Ramla is revered in Islam as the shrine of the prophet Saleh, while the Church of Saint George in Lod is venerated in Christianity and Islam as the tomb of Saint George or Al Khidr. Numerous other religious sites can be found in the West Bank, including Joseph's Tomb in Nablus, the birthplace of Jesus, and Rachel's Tomb in Bethlehem.",
        "Many non-numerical symbols were arranged to mirror their counterparts on manual typewriters, which is significant because this layout was developed for mechanical, not electronic typewriters. Mechanical typewriters adhered to the Remington No. 2 (1878) standard, as it was the first machine with a shift key. The shifted values of 2#3$4%5&6'8_(9- were initially omitted by early typewriters, using O (capital o) and L (lowercase L) for 0 and 1, respectively. However, as 0 and 1 gained more common usage, the pairs 1! and 0) became standard. As a result, in ASCII, the symbols!#$% were placed in the second column, rows 1-5, corresponding to the digits 1-5 in the adjacent column. The underscore symbol could not correspond to 9 and 0, as the space character occupied that position. This conflict was resolved by excluding the underscore from the symbol set, using the parentheses instead for 9 and 0.",
        "Adolescence signifies a significant transformation in a family's dynamics. Initially, young children exert pressure but hold minimal sway over family matters. However, as adolescence sets in, parents tend to perceive the adolescent as a peer, leading to an increase in the adolescent's ability to influence family decisions. Navigating independence while maintaining a nurturing bond with parents becomes the adolescent's challenge. As children reach puberty, there is frequently an escalation in parent-child disputes and a weaker familial connection. Disagreements often revolve around trivial matters of control, such as curfew, wardrobe choices, and personal privacy, which the adolescent may previously have considered beyond parental jurisdiction. The intensification of parent-adolescent disagreements is also fueled by the growing impact of friends on each other, new influences that might contrast with parents' beliefs. Social media has also gained prominence in fueling parent-adolescent disagreements. Previously, parents did not have to contend with the dangers posed by social platforms.",
        "Microbial culturing serves as a primary diagnostic method for detecting infectious diseases. Within a cultured environment, a selective growth medium is offered to a particular pathogen. A sample obtained from potentially affected tissue or fluid is then assessed for the presence of a disease-causing agent capable of multiplying within this medium. Generally, pathogenic bacteria thrive on nutrient agar, a solid medium providing carbohydrates, proteins, and water required for bacterial growth. An individual bacterium will expand into a visible colony on the medium's surface, either as an isolated formation or coalesced into a \"lawn.\" The colony's size, hue, shape, and structure are indicative of the bacterial species, its unique genetic composition (its strain), and the environment supporting its growth. Additional components may be incorporated into the medium to facilitate identification. Plates might contain components that foster the growth of specific bacteria for better identification.",

The current Head Master, Tony Little, has announced intentions to make Eton accessible to any student, regardless of family income. In 2011, Little stated that around 250 students received \"substantial\" financial aid from the school. By early 2014, this number had increased to 263 students receiving approximately 60% of their school fees covered, with an additional 63 students attending free of charge. Little aims to have 320 students receiving bursaries each year and 70 attending free of charge in the near future.",
        "Prior to the formation of Queen, Brian May and Roger Taylor were bandmates in a group called Smile. Freddie Mercury, a fan of Smile, encouraged them to explore grander stage and recording styles. Mercury joined the band in 1970, proposed the name \"Queen,\" and adopted his iconic stage name. John Deacon was enlisted before recording their self-titled debut album in 1973. Queen gained their first UK chart placement with their second album, Queen II, in 1974. However, it was the releases of Sheer Heart Attack in the same year and A Night at the Opera in 1975 that propelled them to international fame. The latter album included \"Bohemian Rhapsody,\" which remained at number one in the UK for nine consecutive weeks and revolutionized the music video format. Their 1977 album, News of the World, featured \"We Will Rock You\" and \"We Are the Champions,\" which have since become staples at sporting events.",
        "On the 13th of March, the upper Clyde port of Clydebank, situated near Glasgow, suffered a bombing attack. Approximately 11,930 out of its 12,000 homes sustained damage. Various other ports faced similar attacks. Plymouth was attacked five times before the month's end, while Belfast, Hull, and Cardiff also experienced bombings. Cardiff was targeted three consecutive nights, and Portsmouth's city center was devastated by five raids. In September 1940, an average of 40,000 civilians were left homeless each week. By March 1941, two bombing raids on Plymouth and London displaced 148,000 people. Despite the extensive damage, British ports continued to support the war industry and facilitated the passage of supplies from North America. The Royal Navy maintained its operations in Plymouth, Southampton, and Portsmouth. Due to its vulnerable location on the south coast and proximity to German air bases, Plymouth was subjected to the most severe attacks. On the 10th and 11th of March, 240 bombers dropped 193 tons of high explosives and 46,000 incendiary devices. Numerous homes and commercial centers were severely damaged",
        "The origins of collegiate a cappella are uncertain. The Rensselyrics, originally known as the RPI Glee Club and founded in 1873 at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, is possibly the oldest documented collegiate a cappella group [citation needed]. Nevertheless, the longest-standing group might be The Whiffenpoofs of Yale University, which was established in 1909 and featured Cole Porter as a member. Collegiate a cappella groups proliferated throughout the 20th century, with notable historical groups emerging along the way such as the Tigertones of Princeton University (1946), The Colgate 13 of Colgate University (1942), the Aires of Dartmouth College (1946), the Cayuga's Waiters of Cornell University (1949) and The Hangovers (1968), the University of Maine's Maine Steiners (1958), the Columbia University Kingsmen (1949), the Jabberwocks of Brown University (1949), and the University of Rochester's YellowJackets (1956). In the following years, all-female a cappella groups soon appeared, often as a spoof of the men's groups: the Smiffenpoofs of Smith College (1",
        "Adolescent interactions within peer groups enable explorations of feelings and self-discovery, while concurrently fostering and assessing social competencies. Peer networks provide a platform for nurturing skills like empathy, cooperation, and leadership. Adolescents tend to gravitate toward peer groups with shared characteristics. These connections aid adolescents in growing more self-accepting. Group norms and expectations bleed into an adolescent's self-perception. By honing communication skills and scrutinizing those of their associates, as well as their personal opinions and values, adolescents can openly express emotions and other matters without apprehension of rejection or criticism. Peer networks can have a constructive impact on a person, such as boosting academic drive and achievement. However, peers can also potentially impede personal development. Peers may exert negative influences, such as promoting substance experimentation, delinquency, and theft through peer pressure. Vulnerability to peer pressure tends to peak during early adolescence, reaching a high at approximately age 14, and then diminishing over time. Research further reveals the influence of peers.",
        "A time of strife for the Liberals ensued, as John Howard, the former Treasurer, and Andrew Peacock, the former Foreign Minister, vied for dominance. The Australian economy was grappling with the recession of the early 1990s. Unemployment peaked at 11.4% in 1992. In November 1991, under Dr John Hewson's leadership, the opposition unveiled the 650-page Fightback! policy document, a comprehensive set of austere economic liberal policies. These measures included the implementation of a Goods and Services Tax (GST), modifications to Medicare such as the elimination of bulk billing for non-concession holders, a nine-month limit on unemployment benefits, alterations to industrial relations like the abolition of awards, a $13 billion tax cut for middle and high-income earners, $10 billion in government spending reductions, the elimination of state payroll taxes, and the privatization of numerous government-owned enterprises. This marked a significant departure from the keynesian economic conservatism employed by previous Liberal/National Coalition governments, offering a vastly different future trajectory. The policy document proposed a 15% change in various aspects. \u200d",

        "In the last quarter of 1975, Queen created and distributed A Night at the Opera, a title inspired by the iconic Marx Brothers film. At that point, it was the most costly album to be made. Similar to its forerunner, the album boasted various musical genres and innovative uses of stereo sound. Within \"The Prophet's Song,\" an expansive eight-minute piece, the central part employs a canon technique, with basic phrases repeated to generate a choral effect. The ballad \"Love of My Life,\" authored by Mercury, showcased a harp and layered vocal harmonies. The album achieved immense success in Britain and tripled platinum in the US. The British populace ranked it the 13th best album ever in a 2004 Channel 4 poll. Internationally, it has consistently been highly regarded; in a worldwide Guinness survey, it was named the 19th best album of all time, while the Australian public ranked it 28th in an ABC poll. A Night at the Opera has consistently appeared on numerous top album lists.",
        "Although the concept of Mary's Immaculate Conception emerged later among Western (particularly Frankish) theologians, it gained more prominence among Byzantine theologians, who were heavily influenced by the Mariology of Gregory Nazianzen. Although hymn writers and scholars, including Emperor Justinian I, often referred to Mary as \"purified\" in their compositions and creeds, the initial steps towards a more detailed analysis of Nazianzen's perspective can be traced back to Sophronius of Jerusalem. In his writings, Sophronius suggests that the Virgin Mary was already immaculate at the Annunciation and further asserts that John the Baptist was holier than any man born of a woman due to Mary's extraordinary holiness, which surpassed even John's sanctity in the womb. Sophronius' ideas are further developed and reinforced by Saint John Damascene (d. 749/750). In addition to praising the Virgin Mary for her purification at the Annunciation in numerous passages, John Damascene also gives her the unique honor of purifying the waters of baptism by touching them.",

Members of the Hong Kong Alliance for Support of Democratic Movements in China, featuring pro-democracy advocate Szeto Wah, displayed oversized inflatable replicas of the Olympic torch, symbolizing democracy. Their intention was to demand accountability for the Tiananmen Square incidents of 1989 and the establishment of democracy in Hong Kong. Political activist and Legislative Council member Leung Kwok-hung (also known as Longhair) participated in the protest, expressing pride for Hong Kong's citizens still standing up for their beliefs. However, pro-democracy advocates encountered a hostile crowd of torch supporters who hurled insults such as \"rebel,\" \"traitor,\" \"leave,\" and \"I support the Communist Party.\" Meanwhile, approximately 10 members from the Civil Human Rights Front carried orange banners advocating for human rights enhancements and universal suffrage. Onlookers could be heard asking, in Mandarin, \"Are you not Chinese?\" as they attempted to conceal the orange banners with a large Chinese national flag. A woman was observed in the crowd.",
        "The primary industrial sectors in Zhejiang province are electromechanical, textiles, chemicals, food, and construction materials. Over the past few years, Zhejiang has adhered to its unique development strategy, often referred to as the \"Zhejiang model.\" This approach promotes entrepreneurship, supports small businesses responsive to market trends, invests heavily in infrastructure, and manufactures low-cost goods in large quantities for both domestic use and export. This strategy has significantly increased Zhejiang's wealth and earned the \"Zhejiang spirit\" a notable reputation within China. However, concerns have arisen among economists regarding the model's long-term viability, as it may lack efficiency, strain resources such as raw materials and public utilities, and hinder the transition of small businesses to more advanced or technology-focused industries. It's also debatable whether this model can provide a sustainable path for growth.",

        "While Ottoman madrasas encompassed various disciplines, including calligraphy, oratory arts, and theological studies, their primary purpose was to serve as a religious hub for spiritual education. As Ottoman scholar \u0130nalc\u0131k states, \"The ultimate objective of all knowledge, especially the spiritual sciences, is the comprehension of God.\" Religion generally dictated the worth and relevance of each academic pursuit. As \u0130nalc\u0131k further explains, \"Scholars deemed beneficial those disciplines that supported religion, while considering practices such as astrology as detrimental.\" Despite mathematics and logic being part of the madrasa's syllabus, they were all rooted in religious teachings. Mathematics, too, had a religious fervor behind its pedagogy. The Ottoman scholars of madrasas believed that antagonism towards logic and mathematics was pointless, as these disciplines fostered critical thinking and thus assisted in uncovering divine truths \u2013 the crux being \"divine.\" Additionally, \u0130nalc\u0131k notes that even philosophy was tolerated only if it adhered to religious doctrines.",

It was named after the Gallaeci, a Celtic people residing north of the Douro river during the late 1st millennium BC, in an area that largely overlapped with the Iron Age Castro culture. Galicia became part of the Roman Empire following the conclusion of the Cantabrian Wars in 19 BC, later transforming into a Roman province in the 3rd century AD. In 410, the Suebi Germans established a kingdom with Braga (Portugal) as its capital, which was eventually absorbed into the Visigoth kingdom in 585. The Arab invasion of the Iberian Peninsula in 711 led to the seizure of the Visigoth kingdom, but Galicia was soon incorporated into the Christian kingdom of Asturias in 740. Throughout the Middle Ages, the kingdom of Galicia saw periods of self-rule by its own kings, but more often, it was allied with a larger kingdom.",
        "Upon launch, Twilight Princess was widely acclaimed by numerous critics, such as those from 1UP.com, Computer and Video Games, Electronic Gaming Monthly, Game Informer, GamesRadar, IGN, and The Washington Post. Game Informer applauded the game's creativity, likening it to top-tier Hollywood productions. GamesRadar lauded Twilight Princess as a game that deserved only the highest possible recommendation. Cubed3 lauded it as the pinnacle of gaming experiences. Twilight Princess's graphics were generally praised for its art style and animation, although the GameCube, on which it was originally developed, has technical limitations compared to newer generation consoles. IGN and GameSpy pointed out the presence of blurry textures and low-resolution characters. Despite these criticisms, Computer and Video Games believed that the game's atmosphere surpassed that of any previous Zelda game, and regarded Twilight Princess's Hyrule as the best version ever created.

        "Although Britain and its empire emerged victorious from World War II, the aftermath of the conflict was far-reaching, impacting both the domestic landscape and foreign territories significantly. Europe, a once influential continent, lay in ruins, hosting the armies of the United States and the Soviet Union, who had now assumed control of global power. Britain found itself financially drained, on the brink of bankruptcy until 1946, when a $US 4.33 billion loan (equivalent to $56 billion in 2012) from the United States saved the day. This loan was repaid in full in 2006. Meanwhile, anti-colonial movements were gaining momentum in the colonies of European nations, adding to the complexity of the situation. The escalating Cold War tension between the United States and the Soviet Union further muddied the waters. In theory, both nations were against European colonialism. However, American anti-communism took precedence over anti-imperialism, leading the United States to support the continuation of the British Empire to prevent communist expansion.",
        "Homer labels the \"Hellenes\" (/\u02c8h\u025bli\u02d0nz/) as a modest group residing in Thessalian Phthia, whose warriors were led by Achilles. According to the Parian Chronicle, Phthia served as the ancestral land of the Hellenes, with the name \"Hellenes\" being adopted in lieu of the previous designation, the Greeks (\u0393\u03c1\u03b1\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03af). In Greek mythology, Hellen, the forefather of the Hellenes, was the son of Pyrrha and Deucalion, rulers who endured around Phthia, being the sole survivors of a catastrophic flood. It appears that this myth originated as the Greek tribes were gradually splitting in various parts of Greece, signifying their common descent. Aristotle refers to ancient Greece as Hella, an ancestral region.",
        "Despite the Allied advance, the German Air Force (Luftwaffe) could still cause substantial harm. The German conquest of Western Europe brought about an escalation in submarine and air assaults against Britain's sea routes, causing concern among the British. These attacks could have significant implications for the progression of the war if successful by the Germans. Liverpool and its port became a significant stopover for convoys passing through the Western Approaches from North America, carrying essential supplies and materials. The extensive railway system was instrumental in distributing these resources across the nation. Air raids on Liverpool during the Liverpool Blitz were effective. These attacks sunk 39,126 long tons (39,754 t) of shipping, with another 111,601 long tons (113,392 t) damaged. The Minister of Home Security, Herbert Morrison, was concerned about the declining morale, noting the growing defeatism among civilians. Other reports suggest that half of the port's 144 berths were rendered inoperable, while the cargo unloading capacity was decreased by 75%. The roads and railways were obstructed, preventing ships from leaving the harbor. On May 8, 1941, 57 ships were destroyed.",
        "Great construction projects occurred during King George V's reign, with a significant one in 1913. At that time, Sir Aston Webb made alterations to Blore's 1850 East Front, giving it a resemblance to Giacomo Leoni's Lyme Park in Cheshire. The revamped primary fa\u00e7ade (made from Portland stone) was planned to serve as a backdrop for the Victoria Memorial, a grand statue of Queen Victoria placed outside the main gates. Unlike his father Edward VII, George V had a more solemn demeanor. He placed more importance on official events and royal duties rather than extravagant parties. In 1919, he organized command performances showcasing jazz musicians such as the Original Dixieland Jazz Band, marking the first time a head of state watched jazz music. Other notable performances were by Sidney Bechet (1932) and Louis Armstrong. These events earned the palace a nomination for a (Kind of) Blue Plaque by the Brecon Jazz Festival in 2009, recognizing it as one of the British venues that made the most significant contributions to jazz music.",
        "European peace afforded Napoleon an opportunity to concentrate on France's foreign colonies. By 1801, Toussaint Louverture had established himself as a de facto dictator in Saint-Domingue, a colony that had gained political autonomy during the Revolutionary Wars. Napoleon aimed to reclaim the once prosperous colony, as per the Treaty of Amiens. While the National Convention had abolished slavery in France in February 1794, the Treaty of Amiens compelled Napoleon to uphold British demands by not extending the abolition to colonies where the 1794 decree was not implemented. Consequently, the Law of 20 May did not apply to colonies like Guadeloupe or Guyane. However, some rogue military leaders and officials exploited the peace agreement to reintroduce slavery in certain areas, despite the Law of 20 May only restoring the slave trade to the Caribbean colonies, not slavery itself. Napoleon dispatched General Leclerc on an expedition intended to regain control of these colonies.",
        "Mary's absolute purity and freedom from any blemish since her inception was a concept recognized by Byzantine theologians. The concept was initially expounded by St. Gregory Nazianzen, who, in his interpretation of Jesus and Mary's \"purification\" at the circumcision (Luke 2:22), posited that \"purification\" in Christology (and by extension, Mariology) signified a flawless nature that was revealed in splendor through divine intervention, such as at Jesus' Baptism. St. Gregory Nazianzen referred to Mary as \"prokathartheisa (prepurified).\" It is speculated that Gregory's purpose in this designation was to resolve the mystery of Jesus and Mary's purification in the Temple. By viewing the human natures of Jesus and Mary as equally sacred, he concluded that both were purified in the same manner of grace and glory. It is also suggested that Gregory's doctrines on Mary's purification were linked to the growing veneration of the Mother of God in and around Constantinople, which occurred around the time of Christmas. The term \"prepurified\" that Nazianzen used to describe Mary at the Annunciation was later adopted.",
        "The state enjoyed a relatively tranquil atmosphere compared to the rest of the nation, owing to its strong bonds with the United States, until 1841. However, in 1843, the state government started preparing for potential conflict, fortifying its defense lines along the border with Texas. Weapons were dispatched to strengthen the military, and measures were taken to enhance the efficiency at the presidios. By 1846, the Regimen for the Frontier Defenders was established by the state, consisting of light cavalry, four squads of two brigades, and a small unit of 14 soldiers and 42 officials at an annual cost of 160,603 pesos. During the early 1840s, private citizens attempted to halt the supply caravans from the United States, but due to their distant location from central Mexico's main suppliers, the caravan was allowed to proceed in March 1844. In anticipation of war, the state legislature enlisted 6,000 men by decree on July 11, 1846.",
        "In the spring of 1800, Napoleon's army navigated the Swiss Alps, intending to catch the Austrian forces off guard as they had reclaimed Italy while Napoleon was in Egypt. [note 5] The French troops successfully crossed the Alps, encountering minimal resistance as they moved into the Italian plains. As one French army approached from the north, the Austrians were engaged with another army stationed in Genoa, which was under siege by a significant force. The tenacious resistance of the French army, led by Andr\u00e9 Mass\u00e9na, provided the northern attacking force valuable time to conduct their operations with limited interruptions. After a few days of searching for each other, the two armies eventually clashed at the Battle of Marengo on June 14. General Melas commanded approximately 30,000 Austrian soldiers, while Napoleon led around 24,000 French troops. The initial attack by the Austrians took the French by surprise, gradually pushing them back. However, Melas underestimated the resilience of Napoleon's forces, leading to a tight battle in which the numerical advantage of the Austrians seemed insufficient to ensure victory.",
        "In Homer's Iliad, the terms Danaans (also known as Danaoi: \u0394\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03bf\u03af) and Argives (Argives: \u0391\u03c1\u03b3\u03b5\u03af\u03bf\u03b9) are used to denote the Greek forces who clash with the Trojans. The legend of Danaus, who originated from Egypt, forms the foundation myth of Argos. His daughters, the Danaides, were condemned to an impossible task in Tartarus - filling a bottomless bathtub with a jug. This tale is associated with the Sisyphus myth, where a task that can never be accomplished is central. The name Danaans may be derived from the Proto-Indo-European root *danu, meaning \"river.\" The origin of the Danaans remains unclear. Some scholars link the Danaans to the Denyen, one of the sea peoples who assaulted Egypt during the rule of Ramesses III (1187-1156 BCE). The same inscription also mentions the Weshesh, who may have been the Achaeans. The Denyen appear to have inhabited the city Adana in Cilicia. Similar pottery can be found.",
        "In 1969, Arnold Schwarzenegger cohabited with Barbara Outland (later Barbara Outland Baker), an English teacher, until 1974. In his 1977 memoir, Schwarzenegger described their relationship as follows: \"Essentially, she was a level-headed woman seeking a common, stable life, while I was anything but balanced, and despised the notion of a typical life.\" In her memoir published in 2006, entitled \"Arnold and Me: In the Shadow of the Austrian Oak,\" Baker portrayed Schwarzenegger as \"a cheerful, captivating, adventurous, and athletic\" individual, but later claimed he became \"insufferable \u2013 arrogant to the extreme \u2013 with the world revolving around him.\" Despite painting an unfavorable picture of Schwarzenegger in her memoir, Baker worked with him on the book, providing a foreword, and even spent three hours with him during the writing process. Baker revealed in her book that she discovered Schwarzenegger's infidelity only after they parted ways, and described their relationship as turbulent. Although Baker portrayed Schwarzenegger in an unflattering light, he collaborated with her on the tell-all book.",
        "The influence of an adolescent's surroundings significantly impacts their self-formation. While numerous studies on identity development have primarily focused on affluent, middle-class adolescents, research indicates that individuals with a more affluent upbringing tend to develop their identity more successfully. This critical phase in an adolescent's life is when their identity takes shape. Recent demographic trends suggest that the progression into adulthood now spans a longer duration compared to the mid-20th century. Consequently, youth, a phase encompassing late adolescence and early adulthood, has emerged as a more prominent stage of the life cycle. As a result, various factors have gained significance during this developmental period. Factors such as commitment, coping mechanisms, and social media all play a crucial role in shaping an adolescent's social identity. These factors are strongly influenced by the environment in which an adolescent is raised. A privileged upbringing exposes an adolescent to greater opportunities and more favorable circumstances on average.",
        "The regions of Thuringia display a wide variety of landscapes. The northernmost part is dominated by the Harz mountains, transitioning into the Goldene Aue, a productive floodplain around Nordhausen with the Helme as its primary river. The northwest encompasses the Eichsfeld, a hilly and occasionally forested area where the Leine river originates. The central and northern Thuringia is characterized by the expansive Thuringian Basin, spanning approximately 3000 km\u00b2 and offering rich, flat terrain around the Unstrut river, encircled by the successive hill ranges (beginning from the northwest and moving clockwise): D\u00fcn, Hainleite, Windleite, Kyffh\u00e4user, Hohe Schrecke, Schm\u00fccke, Finne, Ettersberg, Steigerwald, Thuringian Forest, H\u00f6rselberge, and Hainich. Within the Basin, smaller hill ranges include Fahner H\u00f6he and Heilinger H\u00f6hen. South of the Thuringian Basin lies the region's largest mountain range, which includes the Thuringian Forest in the northwest, the Thuringian Uplands in the center, and the Franconian range to the south.",
        "Adolescent relationships, be it with peers, family, or community members, significantly impact the social growth of an adolescent. As an adolescent's social circle expands and they start discerning between friends and acquaintances, they often form deep emotional connections with friends. This emotional investment is natural, yet problematic if these friends introduce an adolescent to potentially risky circumstances, which can be a manifestation of peer influence. Adolescence is a pivotal stage in social development as adolescents are highly receptive to influences from their close relationships. This period is marked by their newfound ability to make independent decisions, making it a delicate phase as well. The importance of relationships stems from the powerful impact peers can exert on an adolescent. These relationships become important as they assist the adolescent in comprehending the idea of interpersonal dynamics.",
        "In June 2013, Kanye West and TV personality Kim Kardashian revealed the birth of their first child, North. The announcement of their engagement followed in October 2013, receiving significant media coverage. West revealed in November 2013 that he was starting work on his next studio album, aiming for a mid-2014 release with the help of Rick Rubin and Q-Tip. Adidas announced in December 2013 the commencement of an official apparel partnership with West, to be launched the next year. The couple tied the knot in a private ceremony in Florence, Italy, in May 2014, surrounded by artists and celebrities. West released a single titled \"Only One,\" featuring Paul McCartney, on December 31, 2014. He collaborated with Rihanna and McCartney to produce \"FourFiveSeconds,\" which was released in January 2015. West also performed a new song, \"Wolves,\" on the Saturday Night Live 40th Anniversary Special.",
        "Today, some contemporary rock artists prefer mandolins, opting for single-stringed electric versions over double-stringed acoustic ones. One notable example is Tim Brennan of the Irish-American punk rock band Dropkick Murphys. Apart from electric guitar, bass, and drums, the band incorporates various traditional Celtic music instruments, like the mandolin, tin whistle, and Great Highland bagpipes. The band attributes the use of these instruments to enhancing their signature grunge sound. The 1991 R.E.M. hit \"Losing My Religion\" was marked by some striking mandolin riffs played by guitarist Peter Buck, who also employed the mandolin in nearly a dozen other songs. The track reached No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart (No. 1 on the rock and alternative charts). Luther Dickinson from North Mississippi Allstars and The Black Crowes frequently makes use of the mandolin, particularly evident in several of his works.",
        "Predators and their prey have a reciprocal relationship, with predators preying on one organism while being prey for another. For instance, blue jays feed on insects, but they can be prey for cats and snakes, and snakes can be hunted by hawks. Organisms can be categorized by trophic level, with those feeding on autotrophs (producers) being classified as herbivores or primary consumers, and those feeding on other heterotrophs, such as animals, being designated as secondary consumers. Secondary consumers are a type of carnivore, but there are higher-level consumers that feed on carnivores, known as tertiary consumers. This hierarchy of consumption may extend to quaternary consumers and beyond, but the energy flow usually stops after several levels, rarely exceeding five or six, and sometimes only reaching three trophic levels (e.g., a lion that feeds on large herbivores like wildebeest).",
        "Around 680, Ibn al-Zubayr left Medina for Mecca. Learning about Husayn's resistance against Yazid I, the citizens of Kufa petitioned Husayn to assume power with their backing. Al-Husayn dispatched his cousin Muslim bin Agail to ascertain if they would stand by him. Upon hearing this, Yazid I ordered Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad, the governor of Basrah, to thwart the Kufans from aligning with Al-Husayn. Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad successfully scattered the crowd near Muslim bin Agail and arrested him. Recognizing that Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad had been tasked to hinder Husayn's support in Kufa, Muslim bin Agail requested a message to be relayed to Husayn to discourage his move to Kufa. However, this request was turned down and Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad remained firm in his mission to deter Husayn.",
        "On the 1st of September 1870, the battle commenced, pitting the Army of Ch\u00e2lons, boasting 202 infantry battalions, 80 cavalry squadrons, and 564 guns, against the consolidated Prussian Third and Meuse Armies, comprising 222 infantry battalions, 186 cavalry squadrons, and 774 guns. General De Wimpffen, commanding the French V Corps in reserve, envisioned a coordinated infantry and cavalry assault on the Prussian XI Corps. However, by 11:00, Prussian artillery inflicted significant damage on the French, and further Prussian troops poured onto the battlefield. The French cavalry, under the command of General Marguerite, executed three valiant attacks on the nearby village of Floing, where the Prussian XI Corps was heavily concentrated. Sadly, Marguerite fell during the initial charge, and the subsequent attacks resulted in heavy losses with no progress. By day's end, with no prospects of breaking the Prussian line, the French were forced to regroup."
