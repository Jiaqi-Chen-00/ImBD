Originally equipped with the power to rewind time, this adventure was meant to be straightforward. My plan was to simply charge in, defeat the warlord, and recover the artifact safeguarding my city. However, matters grew intricate, and I endure repeated, agonizing deaths. I've been attempting to advance through this particular chamber for what feels like an eternity now. It's unclear how much actual time has elapsed from my view, as I am compelled to relive the same brief moments over and over. I am trapped in one of the warlord's ante-chambers, where the floor holds eternal, enchanted flames, and the ceiling is adorned with cursed spikes. To assist me in progressing, my goddess has bestowed upon me a spell that allows me to walk on walls. I've utilized it to traverse the room's vertical surfaces.",
        "alien visitors find Earth's other creatures intriguing, but humans seem ordinary to them. Yet, they are intrigued by humanity's tendency to live harmoniously with less intelligent beings. They observe that some humans even value their pets more than their fellow humans. This behavior might hinder human advancement in future centuries. Instead of focusing on such mutual affection, they see the true value in the dogs that humans adore. Their loyalty and dependability make them potential candidates for enslavement. If they were to capture and manipulate these dogs, they could create heartless, genetically superior beings. Unfortunately, humans have not yet recognized this potential. The elevated status they seek will prevent them from achieving a level 3 civilization status.",

Unannounced, you enter Lewis's tent, and the sight inside alters your perspective. \"Lewis, the river this morning is radiantly beautiful! Come take a look, and make some sketches for me, would you?\" You tap the rawhide panel of the borrowed Shoshone dwelling's teepee before shoving aside the entrance flap. \"Even old Charbonneau paused his complaints to marvel...\" Inside, Lewis was seated before a cold hearth, a gourd bowl in his lap, and his hand cradled gently. \"Merri, what are you doing?\" You approach cautiously, but Lewis looks up serenely, showing no alarm on his composed face. \"I'm merely letting some blood,\" Lewis explains, ever the clinical one. \"I've been feeling feverish, due to the pesky mosquitoes, you know, and I'm draining off the toxins.\" You frown. \"It appears this is not your first bout of malaria.\" \"No, and I don't think it will be the last, but thank you for your worry, William,\" he replies.",

Start: 3:53 MST What predominantly occupied his thoughts was his intense thirst. It had been days since he last drank water. He vividly recalled his last sip, taken from a filthy puddle on the street. His lips, after three days, showed signs of cracking and bleeding. Taking refuge in what appeared to be a former store, he surmised it was likely a shop selling women's garments or footwear. Everything now looked the same - dust, shattered concrete, and an endless symphony of noise. The dry, arid atmosphere, coupled with the blurring of days, made it difficult to discern whether it had indeed been three days. Could it have been fewer? \u06f1. The city was wrecked by war, and a teen, hiding in the rubble, faced a soldier, who could be a friend or an enemy. The bombs resumed falling.

He then resumed his journey, finding his car, the last one in the parking lot, as usual, a 1998 black Ford Taurus. With an air of dignity, John walked towards his vehicle, his left hand fishing for his keys in his pocket. Numerous thoughts weighed heavily on his mind, among them, extricating the keys from his wallet without it inadvertently tagging along, much like a prize snatched from a claw machine.

Day 1: For the past decade, I've dedicated myself to aiding my community, ensuring its endurance and growth, even if the future for our world is uncertain. I've passed on all my knowledge to the young, so they can carry on our legacy and guide us into a possible future. I've shielded them, undertaken burdens no man should bear, but I did so to safeguard the village. Don't they understand? Outdated customs won't persist in this world. We must adapt and evolve. That's why I took the life of our elders! They posed a danger to our existence, clinging to the old ways. The past is gone! Now, I am being banished to the most remote and unwelcoming location on the planet - the darkest, most forsaken corners of the earth.\n\nDay 2040: As I approach the end of my isolation, I reflect on the lessons I've learned in the wilderness. I've come to appreciate the simple beauty of nature, and the resilience of life in its rawest form. I've grown stronger, both physically and mentally, and I've found a sense of peace within myself. I've come to understand that",

At times it's the eerie laughter echoing at unexpected hours, other times it's small, uncontained blasts in his backyard, and on occasions it's the questionable companions he entertains. Despite these bothersome quirks, he proves to be a considerate neighbor. It's intriguing to live alongside him, yet for a few minor flaws, I can enumerate several positive aspects about him. To begin with, he spearheads the neighborhood security, or more accurately, he is the neighborhood security. With his fleet of drones, he relentlessly surveils the neighborhood. He doesn't demand remuneration, and when offered, he would modestly say something like \"I would monitor the area regardless, may as well lend a hand.\" A burglary occurred in our neighborhood once, and within an hour, the offender was apprehended. Officially, the thief \"voluntarily\" returned all stolen items and surrendered, but we were well aware of the influence that led him to do so.",

The deserted metropolis is filled with towering concrete canyons, and its streets are strewn with the lifeless bodies of humans - men, women, and children - lying on the frozen ground, abandoned and left to die, with no burial space, as if they were discarded objects. Once bustling forests teeming with wildlife are now silent, filled with decay and twilight that I have brought about. Through the hands of so-called \"scientists,\" I was created.

He perceived the cloud of dust advancing from afar through the window of the hut. He crouched down and started honing the edge of his weapon. It was a rudimentary, ancient piece, resembling a slab of metal rather than a conventional sword. Many believed he wouldn't be capable of wielding it, given his slim, compact physique. He hadn't anticipated being able to wield it when the master weaponsmith had bestowed it upon him. Initially, he had thought it was a jest. He was considered a jest within the Corps, due to his diminutive stature and inclination towards more delicate pursuits. However, the master weaponsmith had forgotten a weapon specifically for him- it was nearly impossible to decline such an honor even if he wished to. He always carried it with him. The smith mentioned that it was a sword meant to be carried. After some time, he discovered that it suited him perfectly.",

This condition originated with me, as I am apparently the first documented case of it. In the initial stages, those close to me saw it as a prank. Medical professionals, on the other hand, doubted my honesty. The scientific community could not fathom a disease that would induce dancing upon hearing music. It was simply inexplicable. However, upon finding out that the condition is contagious, and I transmit it wherever I go, the medical community took a serious interest. Yet, at that time, it was still considered a minor curiosity and did not disrupt my daily life. The apprehension arose when it became apparent that the spread of the disease was escalating. Through thorough testing, doctors discovered that the disease has a delayed onset after exposure. The realization that many people might have contracted the disease without showing symptoms caused alarm, prompting doctors to work diligently towards finding a solution.",

Today, however, holds significance for me - I am to present my findings to the council. After centuries on a barren, decaying planet, it will be a relief to return. My group arrived on Earth around 1850 by your reckoning. We integrated well into your society, I thought. However, we were appalled by what we encountered.

Yet, an unexpected creature obstructed my path, one not typically associated with combat. This creature took me by surprise, as I had not anticipated encountering resistance. I presumed the inhabitants of this blue planet would pose no threat to my mission's completion. However, this creature exhibited a formidable demeanor, its powerful aura commanding attention. As I reached for my disintegration weapon, the creature spoke up before I could complete my action: \"Don't even consider it; I don't intend to harm you, but attempting to use that weapon will result in your demise.\" This situation confounded me, and I inquired: \"Who are you? How did you detect me? And how did you disarm the technology of my spaceship to halt my attack?\" I found these questions puzzling.",

Not the horns themselves, but rather the attention they drew that caught my attention. I had always managed to hide them under my long hair or a hat, but at eight, I started to notice the curious stares. It's odd how something so ingrained in me feels so normal. I had always had horns, so it never occurred to me to question why others didn't have them. But when others began to question me, I started to wonder.

Life had been uneventful lately, and in my mind, he was still alive, calling to share a groundbreaking discovery about his work. I hesitated, clutching my phone, gazing at the satisfied smile on the screen. Should I accept the call? But who could be using his number? Why? Why would they do this to me? I decided to answer.

It's alright, everything will be alright, I reassured myself, Jimmy. In a moment of hope, I suggested we visit the kind people at Panera Bread for leftovers. Excited, I leaped to my feet as my master rose to join me. We walked for about a mile before my master stopped and indicated for me to wait outside.

The possibility was petrifying. If the proof lay hidden in the abyss of the endless dark, would it confirm his actions until this moment? No one had fathomed his actions, the horrors he'd endured to reach this stage. Grandeur was promised, they assured him, and he had faith, followed them, or so he assumed. \"Puppet\" he muttered bitterly, filled with self-disgust.

My face aches from the force of my smile as she reveals her gleaming, toothless grin. These moments were too infrequent. I glance at her mother, and we bask in the shared experience. She dons my cherished dress (I hesitate to admit it, but it's hers, not mine), yet she appears somewhat lifeless, unresponsive. There's no hint of a smile's curve, no movement in her hair. It's never been like this. The rigid band at the back of my head feels uncomfortable.",

As the British forces pressed forward relentlessly, the American infantry hastily attempted to establish cohesive lines for defense. The relentless British infantry advanced in steady, disciplined formations. British artillery persisted in its brutal duty with precise accuracy, causing significant challenges for the Americans to effectively form their lines. Before long, the American artillery responded in kind, and both sides found themselves advancing towards each other amidst clouds of dust and smoke, stumbling over their own fallen comrades. As the two forces neared their final preparations, the front lines readied their rifles and took aim. In harmony, both sides discharged their initial volleys, causing a deafening sound and the distinct Ziiiipppp! of supersonic ammunition. More casualties were sustained, and the subsequent ranks prepared to fire their own volleys. It was then, in the rifle of a soldier, a small lead bullet inexplicably came to life.",

From the line emerged a solitary rider, his gaze fixed on the approaching Mexican foot soldiers. He wheeled his horse to face his comrades. His pristine red uniform and campaign hat seemed incongruous in the arid landscape, yet he showed no signs of discomfort. He swallowed hard, then spoke up. \"Gentlemen, I will not deceive you.

        "In this realm, a person's exterior is solely shaped by their character. At birth, all infants are indistinguishable. Beauty emerges progressively through positive thoughts and actions, while the contrary develops for unattractiveness. The extraordinary instances capture headlines, but it's the shocking ones that linger in people's minds. As children mature, they are encouraged to have faith in beauty, as it is the beautiful who are considered good. Negative thoughts leave a lasting impression on one's visage. Each line and blemish represents a cruel thought, while each unappealing feature symbolizes a cruel act. This truth is well-known to society. As a result, the unusual cases stand out. When Jessica Hart first appears in the media, most assume her innocence. Her breathtaking beauty outshines even those who devote their lives to helping others. A person that beautiful could never be guilty of the crimes they are accused of. Torture, murder, and cannibalism - just one of these acts is enough to cast doubt on her innocence.",

Spurred by this inner resolve, I muster the courage to venture out and examine the source of the light. Guided by the brightest aspect of the burst, I tread cautiously through the dark forest. My familiarity with the terrain spares me from tripping over fallen debris or snagging my feet on shrubs. However, as I round a tree, a strange new light appears.

The mentor who bestowed upon me the burden of foreseeing these predetermined deaths did indeed come to pass.

The earth they grew upon was mainly synthetic, with only token amounts of genuine soil as a decorative touch, and the illumination sustaining them now was directed, without the unpredictable fluctuations of the seasons. The scene seemed reminiscent of the original state, as the final moments approached. I sighed deeply and lounged under the apple tree, savoring the last rays of warmth.

It is revealed that the planet was propelled into its current orbit due to a cosmic conflict. The urgency to prevent Earth from facing a similar destiny intensifies. I was unprepared for this turn of events. I found myself pondering a suitable response. If being the nation's president wasn't challenging enough, I thought, shaking my head. \"They have overstepped their bounds now\" I mused. I summoned my secretary to set up a meeting with the New Horizons crew. \"Forget the AMA, bring them to my office immediately. It's an order!\" I barked over the phone. The New Horizons team arrived within an hour. Naturally, I arranged a private jet for their travel, although it may have sparked some skepticism and sensationalist media headlines \u2013 but I couldn't care less. I needed this situation resolved. We convened in the meeting with a sense of urgency.",

Little did I know that the end times would commence as I was serenading my sandwich in my pajamas. It was just another typical Tuesday morning. I had the day off, thus, I exercised my authority to spend the entire day in my casual attire, playing video games, with no particular reason to the contrary. As it was lunchtime, I found myself in the kitchen preparing a couple of sandwiches. They were quite mundane, consisting merely of turkey, spicy cheese, and a touch of mustard. \"Sandwich, sandwich, what's that? Sandwich!\" I hummed while adding the mustard to the bread. However, my dance moves disturbed the usual pattern I create with the mustard, resulting in a strange symbol instead. The sky suddenly darkened, and the air reeked of ozone. The hairs on the back of my neck stood up in alarm.",

Each time you endeavor to do so, someone else has previously posted the same concept, verbatim. \"What the heck?!\" I rubbed my temple. It seems to happen again. On this occasion, the prompt read: \"[WP] A man attempts a one-handed handstand atop a rocket-boosted motorcycle traveling at 80mph, while simultaneously spinning a basketball with his toes, playing Clash Royale with his free hand, waving at an elderly woman passing by with his other foot, and blaring dubstep from his speakers as he accelerates towards the gates of hell, running over a three-headed squirrel along the way.\" Surely, such an intricate and original concept can't be replicated, right?

Amid the pulsing lights, rowdy mirth, sports broadcasts echoing from the television, and the deafening music from the adjoining room, it proved challenging to maintain a lucid mind. \"Your humor is commendable. Shall I refill your drink?\" the bartender inquired. I nodded in consent, and he whisked my drink off the counter. I surveyed the room, searching for any anomalies. A woman of approximately my stature settled down next to me. \"There are other available seats, you know,\" I pointed out. She merely shrugged and the bartender returned with my drink. He turned to the woman, inquiring about her preference, and she ordered a drink that was unfamiliar to me. \"What is your name?\" she let out in an unexpectedly high-pitched voice. \"I am Reia, and you?\" \"My name is Karma,\" she echoed in the same tone.",

I recall when Pok\u00e9mon battles were imbued with honor. When trainers derived satisfaction from their training prowess, and Pok\u00e9mon engaged in combat one moment, then frolicked the next. As I traversed Viridian City, I winced at the jarring evidence of societal evolution. As I continued, a young girl, barely beyond her pre-teen years, exited the Pok\u00e9 Mart. In tow was her Machop, bearing their acquisitions: Firearms. The Machop brandished a pair of handguns, while a rifle rested on his back. Across his shoulder hung a series of grenades, retailing for 100 Pok\u00e9 coins. The commercialization of this violent carnage left me nauseous. Pok\u00e9balls of a higher value had been known during my trainer years. Despite the passage of time, that day remained vividly etched in my memory.

Her arms, securely around my shoulders, felt like a beacon amidst the throng on the dance floor. \"Once more, I appreciate your company. I wouldn't have dared come alone,\" I confessed. I glanced at her dancing shoes, the warm, soft glow from the chandelier reflecting off her polished deep blue heels. \"Naturally. I'm just pleased you asked me.\" The sound of her voice made me dizzied. The rhythm, the subtle emphasis on vowels, the scent of her breath: all combined to make me shudder in the midst of the sweaty crowd. \"Interestingly, I've yearned to visit this place for a while.

Standing near the train door with six other individuals and a dog, I am one of the few who have claimed a spot. An elderly woman, her hair blond, sits on the only fold-down seat, her red coat creating a striking contrast against the muted tones dominating the rest of the compartment.

The Dragonborn's body lay peacefully on a slab of concrete, surrounded by numerous candles, with their wax gradually seeping into his robes. \"An arrow to the knee,\" the thief remarked, \"such a pity.\" He then produced his black soul gem, a unique, large stone the size of his forearm, and with a skilled touch, began to draw the soul from the Dragonborn's body. \"Still just as dead,\" he mused.

Known as the \"gentleman thief,\" James took pride in not just stealing, but also in brightening his victims' days while he lightened their pockets. This seemingly kind gesture served as an ideal distraction for his theft. The bright sun shone upon the crowded streets as James, attired in his finest clothing, strolled along Grant Avenue in San Francisco's Chinatown. James preferred targeting foreign locations, as the items he'd acquire would possess a more sophisticated taste. He often likened visiting these areas to \"shopping for antiques with a blindfold.\" However, today marked a significant change in the lifestyle of the gentleman thief. Upon spotting an ideal target, a wealthy-looking individual, James realized this would be his last day walking in the sun.",

As Mike scanned the area for his date, he had been waiting for nearly fifteen minutes with no sign. Just as Mike was contemplating leaving, a woman suddenly appeared by his side and touched his arm. \"Impressive Widowmaker costume, did you create it yourself?\" The woman, with a French accent, revealed she had indeed made it. She proposed a dance, and the two engaged in conversation for half an hour about shared interests. As Mike leaned in for a kiss, the woman interrupted, her eyes expressing mild panic. She warned him, \"We need to depart immediately. There are individuals here plotting to harm me.\" \"Hold on, who's trying to harm you?\"",

Forgive me if my plea seems unconventional. Raymond is an admirable individual, and I implore you to grant me the strength to grow fond of him. He showers Emmy and Jacoby with immense affection; his treatment towards me, despite my unrequited feelings, is marked by patience and respect that sometimes stirs anger within me for not being genuinely in love with him. It appears extremely unjust to him, but I suspect that such 'business' arrangements are not uncommon in marriage. I believe I can make this work, at least for the following decade or so, until Jacoby completes his education.

        "[ wp ] Mr. Johnson, our history teacher, explained that the wound which killed Achilles in his last battle at Troy perfectly mirrors the birthmark many people have on their heels. He noted that when Thetis dipped her son in the Styx River, she held him only by the heel, leaving that area vulnerable. An arrow, shot by Paris and guided by Athena, struck that vulnerable spot, causing Achilles' immediate demise. Considering the type of arrows used by the Trojans, it likely left a triangular mark on his heel.\n\nUpon hearing this, I found myself examining my own heel more closely, as I realized I bore a birthmark that seemed to fit this description.

It had been two years since I left my job and relocated. Two years since I abandoned my past, a break I wished were a more definitive line. \"Our program expects a high level of success from...\" How many more years had I intended to delay this decision?

I showed him the bag of letters. \"Does it seem like any letters are absent? I know you're disheartened, but show some decorum, Satan,\" I perhaps said a bit too brusquely. He murmured something dark under his breath and continued to grapple with crafting a word. He eventually managed to form \"gaze\" and I smirked slightly. The game began to progress smoothly until I had only one letter left. Satan wore a smug grin due to his substantial lead and the solitary letter remaining.

Meanwhile, on the other side of the ocean, a river of molten fire flowed from the Midwest of the U.S., creating a trail of black smoke from Canada to Brazil.

My mother was reluctant about the doctor's suggestion. \"Reading?\" Dr. Milonas smiled, perhaps having had this discussion countless times before. \"Yes. The child, Josh, needs to learn to read and write.\" \"But he's merely nine years old! Teaching a *child* to *read*? That would be preposterous even for a child without memory impairment.\" \"Mrs. Smith, you've traveled great distances to seek my help. At least grant me a few minutes of your time.\" My mother remained silent, which Dr. Milonas took as his cue to continue. \"I've discovered that children as young as six can learn to read and write with similar effectiveness.\"",
        "[ IP ] The Absence of Alien Communication: First Contact was Anticlimactic. The initial message received was rather straightforward, \"Silence, idiots. They're listening.\" This message was broadcast across every television channel and frequency known to humanity simultaneously. The words were pieced together from various TV shows and films, resembling an intergalactic warning note. Despite our efforts to trace the signal to its origin, it appeared to emanate from the void of space. This revelation indicated two significant truths about the universe. 1) We were not the only inhabitants. The existence of other life forms was undeniable and widespread. 2) Sinister entities lurk among the stars. Earth's broadcasting ceased abruptly, sometimes forcibly, following First Contact. The United Nations began discussions to establish a United Earth, and military spending increased significantly. Unfortunately, the warning arrived just in time. Two decades later, we experienced Second Contact, a three-month-long event that left half the planet in ruins.",
        "\"A celestial body devoid of starlight\" A rogue planet, drifting amid the cold, desolate expanse of the cosmos. The closest nebulae were light-decades away, offering no celestial body to provide light. No external heat source, no nearby supernovae to disrupt its lonely existence. It was shrouded in darkness, moving aimlessly. However, beneath its crust, over millions of years, life somehow found its way here. It evolved and flourished near the vents stimulated by the intense heat generated by the planet's iron core. As time passed, it became self-aware, discovering concepts like love, deities, and loss. Eventually, scientific thought emerged, followed closely by curiosity. They spent countless years studying, hypothesizing, and guessing under miles of thick rocky crust, striving to uncover the mysteries that lay beyond the ceiling of their existence. Despite being hundreds of miles below the surface, they continued to delve deeper, seeking to penetrate the planet's inner layers.",

One day, you discover your robot creating another robot to do its work. \"Did you truly believe I wouldn't notice you constructing a robot in my garage?\" \"No, Tom, I didn't anticipate. However, I did calculate the likelihood of you discovering my robot-building activity to be 70.105%.\" Robot-Hitler rose to his feet, awaiting his creators' decision.

The rainfall muffles the smoke rising from the bombed-out town that was once his childhood haven. Just hours ago, Ptusha had a home and a family.

        "You're suspected of being a habitual deceiver. Provide proof of your honesty. To excel at deception, one must possess an intimate knowledge of the truth. One must be aware of what one is concealing, what one is avoiding. Within every falsehood, there is a hidden truth, a distorted boundary. The truth is always present; one simply needs to uncover it. Thus, it could be that I am lying, or perhaps I am telling the truth, knowing full well that you would not believe me. It could be a combination of both: just enough truth to persuade you, just enough deceit to hide behind. I'm not asking you to accept my words as truth. After all that has transpired, I realize the futility of asking for your trust. However, the essential question remains: why? Another trait of liars: we are clever. There is never only a single level, but always a hidden purpose. The key is to comprehend the individuals, not the game. The game is straightforward. The rules are clear once one understands them.",

However, on the fateful day of my own extinguishing, I could not help but interpret the screams as anything but happiness. I was illumining a dinner gathering in the cozy apartment of a kind-hearted family - the mother, her spouse, their two adorable twin daughters, and their son. I was particularly fond of the twins, who found me captivating and intrigued by the unique light I emitted. After the meal, when they retreated into the kitchen, one of the little girls inadvertently knocked over the father's wine glass, spilling it all over me! My flame flickered out but continued to burn on the tablecloth. It soon engulfed the entire cloth in flames. The children were alarmed and let out ear-piercing shrieks! Their mother rushed back to find chaos and commotion."
