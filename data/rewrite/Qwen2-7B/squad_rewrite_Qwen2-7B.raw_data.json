{"original": ["Like the reptiles, birds are primarily uricotelic, that is, their kidneys extract nitrogenous waste from their bloodstream and excrete it as uric acid instead of urea or ammonia through the ureters into the intestine. Birds do not have a urinary bladder or external urethral opening and (with exception of the ostrich) uric acid is excreted along with feces as a semisolid waste. However, birds such as hummingbirds can be facultatively ammonotelic, excreting most of the nitrogenous wastes as ammonia. They also excrete creatine, rather than creatinine like mammals. This material, as well as the output of the intestines, emerges from the bird's cloaca. The cloaca is a multi-purpose opening: waste is expelled through it, most birds mate by joining cloaca, and females lay eggs from it. In addition, many species of birds regurgitate pellets. Males within Palaeognathae (with the exception of the kiwis), the Anseriformes (with the", "Mammalian hair, also known as pelage, can vary in color between populations, organisms within a population, and even on the individual organism. Light-dark color variation is common in the mammalian taxa. Sometimes, this color variation is determined by age variation, however, in other cases, it is determined by other factors. Selective pressures, such as ecological interactions with other populations or environmental conditions, often lead to the variation in mammalian coloration. These selective pressures favor certain colors in order to increase survival. Camouflage is thought to be a major selection pressure shaping coloration in mammals, although there is also evidence that sexual selection, communication, and physiological processes may influence the evolution of coloration as well. Camouflage is the most predominant mechanism for color variation, as", "Education in Israel is highly valued in the national culture with its historical values dating back to Ancient Israel and was viewed as one fundamental blocks of ancient Israelite life. Israeli culture views higher education as the key to higher mobility and socioeconomic status in Israeli society. The emphasis of education within Israeli society goes to the gulf within the Jewish diaspora from the Renaissance and Enlightenment Movement all the way to the roots of Zionism in the 1880s. Jewish communities in the Levant were the first to introduce compulsory education for which the organized community, not less than the parents, was responsible for the education of the next generation of Jews. With contemporary Jewish culture's strong emphasis, promotion of scholarship and learning and the strong propensity to promote cultivation of intellectual pursuits as well as the nations high university educational attainment rate exemplifies how highly Israeli society values higher education. The Israeli education system has been praised", "The Daily Northwestern is the main student newspaper. Established in 1881, and published on weekdays during the academic year, it is directed entirely by undergraduates. Although it serves the Northwestern community, the Daily has no business ties to the university, being supported wholly by advertisers. It is owned by the Students Publishing Company. North by Northwestern is an online undergraduate magazine, having been established in September 2006 by students at the Medill School of Journalism. Published on weekdays, it consists of updates on news stories and special events inserted throughout the day and on weekends. North by Northwestern also publishes a quarterly print magazine. Syllabus is the undergraduate yearbook. First published in 1885, the yearbook is an epitome of that year's events at Northwestern. Published by Students Publishing Company and edited by Northwestern students, it is distributed in late May. Northwestern Flipside is an undergraduate satirical magazine. Founded in 2009, The", "Following the fall of Wu and the turmoil of the Wu Hu uprising against the Jin dynasty (265\u2013420), most of elite Chinese families had collaborated with the non-Chinese rulers and military conquerors in the north. Some may have lost social privilege, and took refugee in areas south to Yangtze River. Some of the Chinese refugees from north China might have resided in areas near Hangzhou. For example, the clan of Zhuge Liang (181\u2013234), a chancellor of the state of Shu Han from Central Plain in north China during the Three Kingdoms period, gathered together at the suburb of Hangzhou, forming an exclusive, closed village Zhuge Village (Zhege Cun), consisting of villagers all with family name \"Zhuge\". The village has intentionally isolated itself from the surrounding communities for centuries to this day, and only recently came to be known in public. It suggests that a small number of powerful, elite Chinese refugees from the Central Plain might have taken refugee in", "The '98 season would begin on a somber note with the death of legendary broadcaster Harry Caray. After the retirement of Sandberg and the trade of Dunston, the Cubs had holes to fill and the signing of Henry Rodr\u00edguez, known affectionately as \"H-Rod\" to bat cleanup provided protection for Sammy Sosa in the lineup, as Rodriguez slugged 31 round-trippers in his first season in Chicago. Kevin Tapani led the club with a career high 19 wins, Rod Beck anchored a strong bullpen and Mark Grace turned in one of his best seasons. The Cubs were swamped by media attention in 1998, and the team's two biggest headliners were Sosa and rookie flamethrower Kerry Wood. Wood's signature performance was one-hitting the Houston Astros, a game in which he tied the major league record of 20 strikeouts in nine innings. His torrid strikeout numbers earned Wood the nickname \"Kid K,\" and ultimately earned him the 1998 NL Rookie of the Year award. Sosa caught fire in June, hitting a major league record 20 home runs in the", "In contemporary society, adolescents also face some risks as their sexuality begins to transform. While some of these, such as emotional distress (fear of abuse or exploitation) and sexually transmitted infections/diseases (STIs/STDs), including HIV/AIDS, are not necessarily inherent to adolescence, others such as teenage pregnancy (through non-use or failure of contraceptives) are seen as social problems in most western societies. One in four sexually active teenagers will contract an STI. Adolescents in the United States often chose \"anything but intercourse\" for sexual activity because they mistakenly believe it reduces the risk of STIs. Across the country, clinicians report rising diagnoses of herpes and human papillomavirus (HPV), which can cause genital warts, and is now thought to affect 15 percent", "Throughout the history of the South Slavs, the vernacular, literary, and written languages (e.g. Chakavian, Kajkavian, Shtokavian) of the various regions and ethnicities developed and diverged independently. Prior to the 19th century, they were collectively called \"Illyric\", \"Slavic\", \"Slavonian\", \"Bosnian\", \"Dalmatian\", \"Serbian\" or \"Croatian\". As such, the term Serbo-Croatian was first used by Jacob Grimm in 1824, popularized by the Vienna philologist Jernej Kopitar in the following decades, and accepted by Croatian Zagreb grammarians in 1854 and 1859. At that time, Serb and Croat lands were still part of the Ottoman and Austrian Empires. Officially, the language was called variously Serbo-Croat, Croato-Serbian, Serbian and Croatian, Croatian and Serbian, Serbian or Croatian, Croatian or Serbian. Unofficially, Serbs and Croats typically called the language \"Serbian\" or \"Croatian\", respectively, without implying a distinction between the two, and again in independent Bosnia and Herzegovina, \"Bosnian\", \"Croatian\", and \"Serbian\" were considered to be three names of a single", "Identity development is a stage in the adolescent life cycle. For most, the search for identity begins in the adolescent years. During these years, adolescents are more open to 'trying on' different behaviours and appearances to discover who they are. In other words, in an attempt to find their identity and discover who they are adolescents are liking to cycle through a number of identities to find one that suits them best. But, developing and maintaining identity (in adolescent years) is a difficult task due to multiple factors such as family life, environment, and social status. Empirical studies suggest that this process might be more accurately described as identity development, rather than formation, but confirms a normative process of change in both content and structure of", "The vast Seleucid Empire was, like Egypt, mostly dominated by a Greco-Macedonian political elite. The Greek population of the cities who formed the dominant elite were reinforced by emigration from Greece. These cities included newly founded colonies such as Antioch, the other cities of the Syrian tetrapolis, Seleucia (north of Babylon) and Dura-Europos on the Euphrates. These cities retained traditional Greek city state institutions such as assemblies, councils and elected magistrates, but this was a facade for they were always controlled by the royal Seleucid officials. Apart from these cities, there were also a large number of Seleucid garrisons (choria), military colonies (katoikiai) and Greek villages (komai) which the Seleucids planted throughout the empire to cement their rule. This 'Greco-Macedonian' population (which also", "The implications are multiple as various research traditions are now[when?] heavily utilizing the lens of identity to examine phenomena.[citation needed] One implication of identity and of identity construction can be seen in occupational settings. This becomes increasing challenging in stigmatized jobs or \"dirty work\" (Hughes, 1951). Tracy and Trethewey (2005) state that \"individuals gravitate toward and turn away from particular jobs depending in part, on the extent to which they validate a \"preferred organizational self\" (Tracy & Tretheway 2005, p. 169). Some jobs carry different stigmas or acclaims. In her analysis Tracy uses the example of correctional officers trying to shake the stigma of \"glorified maids\" (Tracy & Tretheway 2005). \"The process by which people arrive at justifications of and values for various occupational choices.\" Among these are workplace satisfaction and overall quality of life (Tracy & Scott 2006, p. 33). People in these types of jobs are", "Emotions can motivate social interactions and relationships and therefore are directly related with basic physiology, particularly with the stress systems. This is important because emotions are related to the anti-stress complex, with an oxytocin-attachment system, which plays a major role in bonding. Emotional phenotype temperaments affect social connectedness and fitness in complex social systems (Kurt Kortschal 2013). These characteristics are shared with other species and taxa and are due to the effects of genes and their continuous transmission. Information that is encoded in the DNA sequences provides the blueprint for assembling proteins that make up our cells. Zygotes require genetic information from their parental germ cells, and at every speciation event, heritable traits that have enabled its ancestor to", "Stanley Schachter formulated his theory on the earlier work of a Spanish physician, Gregorio Mara\u00f1\u00f3n, who injected patients with epinephrine and subsequently asked them how they felt. Interestingly, Mara\u00f1\u00f3n found that most of these patients felt something but in the absence of an actual emotion-evoking stimulus, the patients were unable to interpret their physiological arousal as an experienced emotion. Schachter did agree that physiological reactions played a big role in emotions. He suggested that physiological reactions contributed to emotional experience by facilitating a focused cognitive appraisal of a given physiologically arousing event and that this appraisal was what defined the subjective emotional experience. Emotions were thus a result of two-stage process: general physiological arousal, and experience of emotion. For example, the physiological arousal, heart pounding, in a response to an evoking stimulus, the sight of a bear in the kitchen.", "The political turmoil continued. John began to explore an alliance with the French king Philip II, freshly returned from the crusade. John hoped to acquire Normandy, Anjou and the other lands in France held by Richard in exchange for allying himself with Philip. John was persuaded not to pursue an alliance by his mother. Longchamp, who had left England after Walter's intervention, now returned, and argued that he had been wrongly removed as justiciar. John intervened, suppressing Longchamp's claims in return for promises of support from the royal administration, including a reaffirmation of his position as heir to the throne. When Richard still did not return from the crusade, John began to assert that his brother was dead or otherwise permanently lost. Richard had in fact been captured en route to England by the Duke of Austria and was handed over to Emperor Henry VI, who held him for ransom. John seized the opportunity and went", "Early Modern universities initially continued the curriculum and research of the Middle Ages: natural philosophy, logic, medicine, theology, mathematics, astronomy (and astrology), law, grammar and rhetoric. Aristotle was prevalent throughout the curriculum, while medicine also depended on Galen and Arabic scholarship. The importance of humanism for changing this state-of-affairs cannot be underestimated. Once humanist professors joined the university faculty, they began to transform the study of grammar and rhetoric through the studia humanitatis. Humanist professors focused on the ability of students to write and speak with distinction, to translate and interpret classical texts, and to live honorable lives. Other scholars within the university were affected by the humanist approaches to learning and their linguistic expertise in relation to ancient texts, as well as the ideology that advocated the ultimate importance of those texts. Professors of medicine such as Niccol\u00f2 Leoniceno, Thomas Linacre and William Cop were often trained in and taught from a humanist perspective as", "Democratic Party candidates were consistently elected to local office, increasing the city's ties to the South and its dominant party. In 1861, Mayor Fernando Wood called on the aldermen to declare independence from Albany and the United States after the South seceded, but his proposal was not acted on. Anger at new military conscription laws during the American Civil War (1861\u20131865), which spared wealthier men who could afford to pay a $300 (equivalent to $5,766 in 2016) commutation fee to hire a substitute, led to the Draft Riots of 1863, whose most visible participants were ethnic Irish working class. The situation deteriorated into attacks on New York's elite, followed by attacks on black New Yorkers and their property after fierce competition for a decade between Irish immigrants and blacks for work. Rioters burned the Colored Orphan Asylum to the ground, but more than 200 children escaped harm due to efforts of the", "But in the mid-18th century, during the French Enlightenment, a more ideological use of the term had come into use. In 1765, the author of an anonymous article in a French Enlightenment periodical spoke of \"The general love of humanity ... a virtue hitherto quite nameless among us, and which we will venture to call 'humanism', for the time has come to create a word for such a beautiful and necessary thing\". The latter part of the 18th and the early 19th centuries saw the creation of numerous grass-roots \"philanthropic\" and benevolent societies dedicated to human betterment and the spreading of knowledge (some Christian, some not). After the French Revolution, the idea that human virtue could be created by human reason alone independently from traditional religious institutions, attributed by opponents of the Revolution to Enlightenment philosophes such as Rousseau, was violently", "The result was a sequence of innovative but unpopular financial measures.[nb 10] John levied scutage payments eleven times in his seventeen years as king, as compared to eleven times in total during the reign of the preceding three monarchs. In many cases these were levied in the absence of any actual military campaign, which ran counter to the original idea that scutage was an alternative to actual military service. John maximised his right to demand relief payments when estates and castles were inherited, sometimes charging enormous sums, beyond barons' abilities to pay. Building on the successful sale of sheriff appointments in 1194, John initiated a new round of appointments, with the new incumbents making back their investment through increased fines and penalties, particularly in the forests. Another innovation of Richard's, increased charges levied on widows who wished to remain single, was expanded under John. John continued to sell charters for new towns, including", "A number of novel ideas about religion developed with the Enlightenment, including Deism and talk of atheism. Deism, according to Thomas Paine, is the simple belief in God the Creator, with no reference to the Bible or any other miraculous source. Instead, the Deist relies solely on personal reason to guide his creed, which was eminently agreeable to many thinkers of the time. Atheism was much discussed, but there were few proponents. Wilson and Reill note that, \"In fact, very few enlightened intellectuals, even when they were vocal critics of Christianity, were true atheists. Rather, they were critics of orthodox belief, wedded rather to skepticism, deism, vitalism, or perhaps pantheism.\" Some followed Pierre Bayle and argued that atheists could indeed be moral men. Many others like Voltaire held that without belief in a God who punishes evil, the moral order of society was undermined. That is, since atheists gave themselves to no Supreme Authority and no law, and had no fear of", "Sleep does not affect acquisition or recall while one is awake. Therefore, sleep has the greatest effect on memory consolidation. During sleep, the neural connections in the brain are strengthened. This enhances the brain\u2019s abilities to stabilize and retain memories. There have been several studies which show that sleep improves the retention of memory, as memories are enhanced through active consolidation. System consolidation takes place during slow-wave sleep (SWS). This process implicates that memories are reactivated during sleep, but that the process doesn\u2019t enhance every memory. It also implicates that qualitative changes are made to the memories when they are transferred to long-term store during sleep. When you are sleeping, the hippocampus replays the events of the day for the neocortex. The neocortex then reviews and processes memories, which moves them into long-term memory. When you do not get enough sleep it makes it more difficult to learn as these neural connections are not as strong, resulting in a lower", "Although people often think that memory operates like recording equipment, it is not the case. The molecular mechanisms underlying the induction and maintenance of memory are very dynamic and comprise distinct phases covering a time window from seconds to even a lifetime. In fact, research has revealed that our memories are constructed. People can construct their memories when they encode them and/or when they recall them. To illustrate, consider a classic study conducted by Elizabeth Loftus and John Palmer (1974) in which people were instructed to watch a film of a traffic accident and then asked about what they saw. The researchers found that the people who were asked, \"How fast were the cars going when they smashed into each other?\" gave higher estimates than those who were asked, \"How fast were the cars going when they hit each other?\" Furthermore, when asked a week later whether they have seen broken glass in the film, those who had been asked the question with smashed were twice more likely to report that they have seen broken", "The area of modern Zhejiang was outside the major sphere of influence of the Shang civilization during the second millennium BC. Instead, this area was populated by peoples collectively known as the Hundred Yue, including the Dongyue and the Ouyue. The kingdom of Yue began to appear in the chronicles and records written during the Spring and Autumn Period. According to the chronicles, the kingdom of Yue was located in northern Zhejiang. Shiji claims that its leaders were descended from the Shang founder Yu the Great. Evidence suggests that Baiyue and the kingdom of Yue possessed their own culture and history that are different from those kingdoms in north and central China, whose cultures and histories were carefully recorded in chronicles and histories during the Spring and Autumn Period and into the Qin dynasty.

Calvin continued to take an interest in the French religious affairs from his base in Geneva. He regularly trained pastors to lead congregations there. Despite heavy persecution, the Reformed tradition made steady progress across large sections of the nation, appealing to people alienated by the obduracy and the complacency of the Catholic establishment. French Protestantism came to acquire a distinctly political character, made all the more obvious by the conversions of nobles during the 1550s. This established the preconditions for a series of conflicts, known as the French Wars of Religion. The civil wars gained impetus with the sudden death of Henry II of France in 1559. Atrocity and outrage became the defining characteristics of the time, illustrated at their most intense in the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre of August 1572, when the Roman Catholic party annihilated between 30,000 and 100,000 Huguenots across France. The wars", "Compared to other team sports, the National Football League preseason is very structured. Every NFL team plays exactly four pre-season exhibition games a year, two at home and two away, with the exception of two teams each year who play a fifth game, the Pro Football Hall of Fame Game. These exhibition games, most of which are held in the month of August, are played for the purpose of helping coaches narrow down the roster from the offseason limit of 90 players to the regular-season limit of 53 players. While the scheduling formula is not as rigid for preseason games as they are for the regular season, there are numerous restrictions and traditions that limit the choices of preseason opponents; teams are also restricted on what days and times they can play these games. Split-squad games, a practice common in baseball and hockey, where a team that is scheduled to play two games on the same day splits their team into two squads,", "The early and mid-1980s saw economic trouble for Libya; from 1982 to 1986, the country's annual oil revenues dropped from $21 billion to $5.4 billion. Focusing on irrigation projects, 1983 saw construction start on \"Gaddafi's Pet Project\", the Great Man-Made River; although designed to be finished by the end of the decade, it remained incomplete at the start of the 21st century. Military spending increased, while other administrative budgets were cut back. Libya had long supported the FROLINAT militia in neighbouring Chad, and in December 1980, re-invaded Chad at the request of the Frolinat-controlled GUNT government to aid in the civil war; in January 1981, Gaddafi suggested a political merger. The Organisation of African Unity (OAU) rejected this, and called for a Libyan withdrawal, which came about in November 1981. The civil war resumed, and so Libya sent troops back in, clashing with French forces who supported the southern Chadian forces.", "South Korea: The event was held in Seoul, which hosted the 1988 Summer Olympics, on April 27. Intended torchbearers Choi Seung-kook and Park Won-sun boycotted the event to protest against the Chinese government's crackdown in Tibet. More than 8,000 riot police were deployed to guard the 24-kilometre route, which began at Olympic Park, which was built when Seoul hosted the 1988 Summer Games. On the day of the torch relay in Seoul, Chinese students clashed with protesters, throwing rocks, bottles, and punches. A North Korean defector whose brother defected to China but was captured and executed by the DPRK, attempted to set himself on fire in protest of China's treatment of North Korean refugees. He poured gasoline on himself but police quickly surrounded him and carried him away. Two other demonstrators tried to storm the torch but failed. Fighting broke out near the beginning of the relay between a group of 500 Chinese supporters and approximately", "Jefferson and James Madison's conceptions of separation have long been debated. Jefferson refused to issue Proclamations of Thanksgiving sent to him by Congress during his presidency, though he did issue a Thanksgiving and Prayer proclamation as Governor of Virginia. Madison issued four religious proclamations while President, but vetoed two bills on the grounds they violated the first amendment. On the other hand, both Jefferson and Madison attended religious services at the Capitol. Years before the ratification of the Constitution, Madison contended \"Because if Religion be exempt from the authority of the Society at large, still less can it be subject to that of the Legislative Body.\" After retiring from the presidency, Madison wrote of \"total separation of the church from the state.\" \" \"Strongly guarded as is the separation between Religion & Govt in the Constitution of the United States,\" Madison wrote, and he declared, \"practical distinction between Religion and Civil Government", "The works of Virgil almost from the moment of their publication revolutionized Latin poetry. The Eclogues, Georgics, and above all the Aeneid became standard texts in school curricula with which all educated Romans were familiar. Poets following Virgil often refer intertextually to his works to generate meaning in their own poetry. The Augustan poet Ovid parodies the opening lines of the Aeneid in Amores 1.1.1\u20132, and his summary of the Aeneas story in Book 14 of the Metamorphoses, the so-called \"mini-Aeneid\", has been viewed as a particularly important example of post-Virgilian response to the epic genre. Lucan's epic, the Bellum Civile has been considered an anti-Virgilian epic, disposing with the divine mechanism, treating historical events, and diverging drastically from Virgilian epic practice. The Flavian poet Statius in his 12-book epic Thebaid engages closely with the poetry of Virgil; in his epilogue he advises his poem not to \"rival the divine Aeneid, but follow afar and ever venerate its footsteps.\" In Silius Italicus, Virgil", "Terry Eastland, the author who wrote From Ending Affirmative Action: The Case for Colorblind Justice states, \"Most arguments for affirmative action fall into two categories: remedying past discrimination and promoting diversity\". Eastland believes that the founders of affirmative action did not anticipate how the benefits of affirmative action would go to those who did not need it, mostly middle class minorities. Additionally, she argues that affirmative action carries with it a stigma that can create feelings of self-doubt and entitlement in minorities. Eastland believes that affirmative action is a great risk that only sometimes pays off, and that without it we would be able to compete more freely with one another. Libertarian economist Thomas Sowell identified what he says are negative results of affirmative action in his book, Affirmative Action Around the World: An Empirical Study. Sowell writes that affirmative action policies encourage non-preferred groups to designate themselves as members of preferred groups [i.e., primary beneficiaries of affirmative action] to", "By far the largest military action in which the United States engaged during this era was the War of 1812. With Britain locked in a major war with Napoleon's France, its policy was to block American shipments to France. The United States sought to remain neutral while pursuing overseas trade. Britain cut the trade and impressed seamen on American ships into the Royal Navy, despite intense protests. Britain supported an Indian insurrection in the American Midwest, with the goal of creating an Indian state there that would block American expansion. The United States finally declared war on the United Kingdom in 1812, the first time the U.S. had officially declared war. Not hopeful of defeating the Royal Navy, the U.S. attacked the British Empire by invading British Canada, hoping to use captured territory as a bargaining chip. The invasion of Canada was a debacle, though concurrent wars with Native Americans on the western front (Tecumseh's War and the Creek War) were more successful. After defeating Napoleon in 1814, Britain sent large veteran armies to invade", "With respect to these outer regions, the Qing maintained imperial control, with the emperor acting as Mongol khan, patron of Tibetan Buddhism and protector of Muslims. However, Qing policy changed with the establishment of Xinjiang province in 1884. During The Great Game era, taking advantage of the Dungan revolt in northwest China, Yaqub Beg invaded Xinjiang from Central Asia with support from the British Empire, and made himself the ruler of the kingdom of Kashgaria. The Qing court sent forces to defeat Yaqub Beg and Xinjiang was reconquered, and then the political system of China proper was formally applied onto Xinjiang. The Kumul Khanate, which was incorporated into the Qing empire as a vassal after helping Qing defeat the Zunghars in 1757, maintained its status after Xinjiang turned into a province through the end of the dynasty in the Xinhai Revolution up until 1930. In early 20th century, Britain sent an expedition force to Tibet and forced Tibetans to", "BYU has 21 NCAA varsity teams. Nineteen of these teams played mainly in the Mountain West Conference from its inception in 1999 until the school left that conference in 2011. Prior to that time BYU teams competed in the Western Athletic Conference. All teams are named the \"Cougars\", and Cosmo the Cougar has been the school's mascot since 1953. The school's fight song is the Cougar Fight Song. Because many of its players serve on full-time missions for two years (men when they're 18, women when 19), BYU athletes are often older on average than other schools' players. The NCAA allows students to serve missions for two years without subtracting that time from their eligibility period. This has caused minor controversy, but is largely recognized as not lending the school any significant advantage, since players receive no athletic and little physical training during their missions. BYU has also received attention from sports networks for refusal to play games on", "John treated the interdict as \"the equivalent of a papal declaration of war\". He responded by attempting to punish Innocent personally and to drive a wedge between those English clergy that might support him and those allying themselves firmly with the authorities in Rome. John seized the lands of those clergy unwilling to conduct services, as well as those estates linked to Innocent himself; he arrested the illicit concubines that many clerics kept during the period, only releasing them after the payment of fines; he seized the lands of members of the church who had fled England, and he promised protection for those clergy willing to remain loyal to him. In many cases, individual institutions were able to negotiate terms for managing their own properties and keeping the produce of their estates. By 1209 the situation showed no signs of resolution, and Innocent threatened to excommunicate John if he did not acquiesce to Langton's appointment. When this threat failed, Innocent", "In mainland China, the Japanese 3rd, 6th, and 40th Divisions massed at Yueyang and advanced southward in three columns and crossed the Xinqiang River, and tried again to cross the Miluo River to reach Changsha. In January 1942, Chinese forces got a victory at Changsha which was the first Allied success against Japan. After the Doolittle Raid, the Japanese army conducted a massive sweep through Zhejiang and Jiangxi of China, now known as the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Campaign, with the goal of searching out the surviving American airmen, applying retribution on the Chinese who aided them and destroying air bases. This operation started on 15 May 1942 with 40 infantry battalions and 15\u201316 artillery battalions but was repelled by Chinese forces in September.

In short, it feels cheap. You don't realize how convenient autoloading disc trays are until they're gone. Whether it was to cut costs or save space, this move is ultimately a step back.\" The criticism also was due to price, stating the cheapest Super Slim model was still more expensive than the cheapest Slim model, and that the smaller size and bigger hard drive shouldn't be considered an upgrade when the hard drive on a Slim model is easily removed and replaced.", "Dorgon's controversial July 1645 edict (the \"haircutting order\") forced adult Han Chinese men to shave the front of their heads and comb the remaining hair into the queue hairstyle which was worn by Manchu men, on pain of death. The popular description of the order was: \"To keep the hair, you lose the head; To keep your head, you cut the hair.\" To the Manchus, this policy was a test of loyalty and an aid in distinguishing friend from foe. For the Han Chinese, however, it was a humiliating reminder of Qing authority that challenged traditional Confucian values. The Classic of Filial Piety (Xiaojing) held that \"a person's body and hair, being gifts from one's parents, are not to be damaged.\" Under the Ming dynasty, adult men did not cut their hair but instead wore", "Boundaries can be inclusive or exclusive depending on how they are perceived by other people. An exclusive boundary arises, for example, when a person adopts a marker that imposes restrictions on the behaviour of others. An inclusive boundary is created, by contrast, by the use of a marker with which other people are ready and able to associate. At the same time, however, an inclusive boundary will also impose restrictions on the people it has included by limiting their inclusion within other boundaries. An example of this is the use of a particular language by a newcomer in a room full of people speaking various languages. Some people may understand the language used by this person while others may not. Those who do not understand it might take the newcomer's use of this particular language merely as a neutral sign of identity. But they might also perceive it as imposing an exclusive boundary that is meant to mark them off from her.

In the UK, Nicole records, made of celluloid or a similar substance coated onto a cardboard core disc, were produced for a few years beginning in 1904, but they suffered from an exceptionally high level of surface noise. In the United States, Columbia Records introduced flexible, fiber-cored \"Marconi Velvet Tone Record\" pressings in 1907, but the advantages and longevity of their relatively noiseless surfaces depended on the scrupulous use of special gold-plated Marconi Needles and the product was not a success.

The date of the assignment was retroactively established on Armistice Day. It is doubtful whether a referendum in Strasbourg would have ended in France's favour since the political parties striving for an autonomous Alsace or a connection to France accounted only for a small proportion of votes in the last Reichstag as well as in the local elections. The Alsatian autonomists who were pro French had won many votes in the more rural parts of the region and other towns since the annexation of the region by Germany in 1871. The movement started with the first election for the Reichstag; those elected were called \"les d\u00e9put\u00e9s protestataires\", and until the fall of Bismarck in 1890, they were the only deputies elected by the Alsatians to the German", "As Western Europe witnessed the formation of new kingdoms, the Eastern Roman Empire remained intact and experienced an economic revival that lasted into the early 7th century. There were fewer invasions of the eastern section of the empire; most occurred in the Balkans. Peace with Persia, the traditional enemy of Rome, lasted throughout most of the 5th century. The Eastern Empire was marked by closer relations between the political state and Christian Church, with doctrinal matters assuming an importance in eastern politics that they did not have in Western Europe. Legal developments included the codification of Roman law; the first effort\u2014the Theodosian Code\u2014was completed in 438. Under Emperor Justinian (r. 527\u2013565), another compilation took place\u2014the Corpus Juris Civilis. Justinian also oversaw the construction of the Hagia Sophia in Constantinople and the reconquest of North Africa from the Vandals and Italy from the Ostrogoths, under Belisarius (d. 565). The conquest of Italy was not complete, as a deadly outbreak of plague in 542 led to the rest of Justinian's reign concentrating on defensive measures", "When Nintendo released the NES in the US, the design styling was deliberately different from that of other game consoles. Nintendo wanted to distinguish its product from those of competitors and to avoid the generally poor reputation that game consoles had acquired following the video game crash of 1983. One result of this philosophy was to disguise the cartridge slot design as a front-loading zero insertion force (ZIF) cartridge socket, designed to resemble the front-loading mechanism of a VCR. The newly designed connector worked quite well when both the connector and the cartridges were clean and the pins on the connector were new. Unfortunately, the ZIF connector was not truly zero insertion force. When a user inserted the cartridge into the NES, the force of pressing the cartridge down and into place bent the contact pins slightly, as well as pressing the cartridge\u2019s ROM board back into the cartridge itself. Frequent insertion and removal of cartridges caused the pins to wear out from repeated usage over the years and the ZIF", "Protestants also took the initiative in advocating for religious freedom. Freedom of conscience had high priority on the theological, philosophical, and political agendas since Luther refused to recant his beliefs before the Diet of the Holy Roman Empire at Worms (1521). In his view, faith was a free work of the Holy Spirit and could, therefore, not be forced on a person. The persecuted Anabaptists and Huguenots demanded freedom of conscience, and they practised separation of church and state. In the early seventeenth century, Baptists like John Smyth and Thomas Helwys published tracts in defense of religious freedom. Their thinking influenced John Milton and John Locke's stance on tolerance. Under the leadership of Baptist Roger Williams, Congregationalist Thomas Hooker, and Quaker William Penn, respectively, Rhode Island, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania combined democratic constitutions with freedom of religion. These colonies became safe havens for persecuted religious minorities, including Jews. The United States Declaration of Independence, the United States Constitution, and the American Bill of Rights with", "Birds have a very efficient system for diffusing oxygen into the blood; birds have a ten times greater surface area to gas exchange volume than mammals. As a result, birds have more blood in their capillaries per unit of volume of lung than a mammal. The arteries are composed of thick elastic muscles to withstand the pressure of the ventricular constriction, and become more rigid as they move away from the heart. Blood moves through the arteries, which undergo vasoconstriction, and into arterioles which act as a transportation system to distribute primarily oxygen as well as nutrients to all tissues of the body. As the arterioles move away from the heart and into individual organs and tissues they are further divided to increase surface area and slow blood flow. Travelling through the arterioles blood moves into the capillaries where gas exchange can occur. Capillaries are organized into capillary beds in tissues, it", "The men's basketball team has over 1,600 wins, one of only 12 schools who have reached that mark, and have appeared in 28 NCAA tournaments. Former player Austin Carr holds the record for most points scored in a single game of the tournament with 61. Although the team has never won the NCAA Tournament, they were named by the Helms Athletic Foundation as national champions twice. The team has orchestrated a number of upsets of number one ranked teams, the most notable of which was ending UCLA's record 88-game winning streak in 1974. The team has beaten an additional eight number-one teams, and those nine wins rank second, to UCLA's 10, all-time in wins against the top team. The team plays in newly renovated Purcell Pavilion (within the Edmund P. Joyce Center), which reopened for the beginning of the 2009\u20132010 season. The team is coached by Mike Brey, who, as of the 2014\u201315 season, his", "One hundred years after the fall of Constantinople in 1453, Pierre Belon described in his work Observations in 1553 that pissasphalto, a mixture of pitch and bitumen, was used in Dubrovnik for tarring of ships from where it was exported to a market place in Venice where it could be bought by anyone. An 1838 edition of Mechanics Magazine cites an early use of asphalt in France. A pamphlet dated 1621, by \"a certain Monsieur d'Eyrinys, states that he had discovered the existence (of asphaltum) in large quantities in the vicinity of Neufchatel\", and that he proposed to use it in a variety of ways \u2013 \"principally in the construction of air-proof granaries, and in protecting, by means of the arches, the water-courses in the city of Paris from the intrusion of dirt and filth\", which at", "Marshall Field & Company originated in 1852. It was the premier department store on the main shopping street in the Midwest, State Street in Chicago. Upscale shoppers came by train from throughout the region, patronizing nearby hotels. It grew to become a major chain before converting to the Macy's nameplate on 9 September 2006. Marshall Field's Served as a model for other departments stores in that it had exceptional customer service. Field's also brought with it the now famous Frango mints brand that became so closely identified with Marshall Field's and Chicago from the now defunct Frederick & Nelson Department store. Marshall Field's also had the firsts, among many innovations by Marshall Field's. Field's had the first European buying office, which was located in Manchester, England, and the first bridal registry. The company was the first to introduce the concept of the personal shopper, and that service was provided without charge in every Field's store, until the chain's last days under the", "Some street trams (streetcars) used conduit third-rail current collection. The third rail was below street level. The tram picked up the current through a plough (U.S. \"plow\") accessed through a narrow slot in the road. In the United States, much (though not all) of the former streetcar system in Washington, D.C. (discontinued in 1962) was operated in this manner to avoid the unsightly wires and poles associated with electric traction. The same was true with Manhattan's former streetcar system. The evidence of this mode of running can still be seen on the track down the slope on the northern access to the abandoned Kingsway Tramway Subway in central London, United Kingdom, where the slot between the running rails is clearly visible, and on P and Q Streets west of Wisconsin Avenue in the Georgetown neighborhood of", "Asian Americans in New York City, according to the 2010 Census, number more than one million, greater than the combined totals of San Francisco and Los Angeles. New York contains the highest total Asian population of any U.S. city proper. The New York City borough of Queens is home to the state's largest Asian American population and the largest Andean (Colombian, Ecuadorian, Peruvian, and Bolivian) populations in the United States, and is also the most ethnically diverse urban area in the world. The Chinese population constitutes the fastest-growing nationality in New York State; multiple satellites of the original Manhattan Chinatown (\u7d10\u7d04\u83ef\u57e0), in Brooklyn (\u5e03\u9c81\u514b\u6797\u83ef\u57e0), and around Flushing, Queens (\u6cd5\u62c9\u76db\u83ef\u57e0), are thriving as traditionally urban enclaves, while also expanding rapidly eastward into suburban Nassau County (\u62ff\u9a37\u7e23) on Long Island (\u9577\u5cf6), as the New York metropolitan region and New York State have become the top destinations for new Chinese immigrants, respectively, and large-scale Chinese immigration continues into New York City and surrounding areas.

They find that the figure of 85% is misleading because it implies that all human populations contain on average 85% of all genetic diversity. They claim that this does not correctly reflect human population history, because it treats all human groups as independent. A more realistic portrayal of the way human groups are related is to understand that some human groups are parental to other groups and that these groups represent paraphyletic groups to their descent groups. For example, under the recent African origin theory the human population in Africa is paraphyletic to all other human groups because it represents the ancestral group from which all non-African populations derive, but more than that, non-African groups only derive from a small non-representative sample of", "Libya's economy witnessed increasing privatization; although rejecting the socialist policies of nationalized industry advocated in The Green Book, government figures asserted that they were forging \"people's socialism\" rather than capitalism. Gaddafi welcomed these reforms, calling for wide-scale privatization in a March 2003 speech. In 2003, the oil industry was largely sold to private corporations, and by 2004, there was $40 billion of direct foreign investment in Libya, a sixfold rise over 2003. Sectors of Libya's population reacted against these reforms with public demonstrations, and in March 2006, revolutionary hard-liners took control of the GPC cabinet; although scaling back the pace of the changes, they did not halt them. In 2010, plans were announced that would have seen half the Libyan economy privatized over the following decade. While there was no accompanying political liberalization, with Gaddafi retaining predominant control, in March 2010, the government devolved further powers to the municipal councils. Rising numbers of", "The initial military maneuvers began in September 1806. In a notable letter to Marshal Soult detailing the plan for the campaign, Napoleon described the essential features of Napoleonic warfare and introduced the phrase le bataillon-carr\u00e9 ('square battalion'). In the bataillon-carr\u00e9 system, the various corps of the Grande Arm\u00e9e would march uniformly together in close supporting distance. If any single corps was attacked, the others could quickly spring into action and arrive to help. Napoleon invaded Prussia with 180,000 troops, rapidly marching on the right bank of the River Saale. As in previous campaigns, his fundamental objective was to destroy one opponent before reinforcements from another could tip the balance of the war. Upon learning the whereabouts of the Prussian army, the French swung westwards and crossed the Saale with overwhelming force. At the twin battles of Jena and Auerstedt, fought on 14 October, the French convincingly defeated", "Regarding the timing of German rapprochement, many historians agree that the dismissal of Maxim Litvinov, whose Jewish ethnicity was viewed unfavorably by Nazi Germany, removed an obstacle to negotiations with Germany. Stalin immediately directed Molotov to \"purge the ministry of Jews.\" Given Litvinov's prior attempts to create an anti-fascist coalition, association with the doctrine of collective security with France and Britain, and pro-Western orientation by the standards of the Kremlin, his dismissal indicated the existence of a Soviet option of rapprochement with Germany.[f] Likewise, Molotov's appointment served as a signal to Germany that the USSR was open to offers. The dismissal also signaled to France and Britain the existence of a potential negotiation option with Germany. One British official wrote that Litvinov's disappearance also meant the loss of an admirable technician or shock-absorber, while Molotov's \"modus operandi\" was \"more truly Bolshevik than diplomatic or cosmopolitan.\" Carr argued that the Soviet Union's replacement of Foreign", "Critics labelled Gaddafi \"despotic, cruel, arrogant, vain and stupid\", with western governments and press presenting him as the \"vicious dictator of an oppressed people\". During the Reagan administration, the United States regarded him as \"Public Enemy No. 1\" and Reagan famously dubbed him the \"mad dog of the Middle East\". According to critics, the Libyan people lived in a climate of fear under Gaddafi's administration, due to his government's pervasive surveillance of civilians. Gaddafi's Libya was typically described by western commentators as \"a police state\". Opponents were critical of Libya's human rights abuses; according to Human Rights Watch (HRW) and others, hundreds of arrested political opponents often failed to receive a fair trial, and were sometimes subjected to torture or extrajudicial execution, most notably in the Abu Salim prison, including an alleged massacre on 29 June 1996 in which HRW estimated that", "A true predator can commonly be known as one that kills and eats another living thing. Whereas other types of predator all harm their prey in some way, this form kills them. Predators may hunt actively for prey in pursuit predation, or sit and wait for prey to approach within striking distance, as in ambush predators. Some predators kill large prey and dismember or chew it prior to eating it, such as a jaguar or a human; others may eat their (usually much smaller) prey whole, as does a bottlenose dolphin swallowing a fish, or a snake, duck or stork swallowing a frog. Some animals that kill both large and small prey for their size (domestic cats and dogs are prime examples) may do either depending upon the circumstances; either would devour a large insect whole but dismember a rabbit. Some predation entails venom that subdues a prey creature before the predator ingests the prey by killing, which the", "Israelites enjoyed political independence twice in ancient history, first during the periods of the Biblical judges followed by the United Monarchy.[disputed \u2013 discuss] After the fall of the United Monarchy the land was divided into Israel and Judah. The term Jew originated from the Roman \"Judean\" and denoted someone from the southern kingdom of Judah. The shift of ethnonym from \"Israelites\" to \"Jews\" (inhabitant of Judah), although not contained in the Torah, is made explicit in the Book of Esther (4th century BCE), a book in the Ketuvim, the third section of the Jewish Tanakh. In 587 BC Nebuchadnezzar II, King of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, besieged Jerusalem, destroyed the First Temple, and deported the most prominent citizens of Judah. In 586 BC, Judah itself ceased to be an independent kingdom, and its remaining Jews were left stateless. The Babylonian exile ended in 539 BCE when the Achaemenid Empire conquered Babylon and Cyrus the", "Van Praag states that the Ming court established diplomatic delegations with Tibet merely to secure urgently needed horses. Wang and Nyima argue that these were not diplomatic delegations at all, that Tibetan areas were ruled by the Ming since Tibetan leaders were granted positions as Ming officials, that horses were collected from Tibet as a mandatory \"corv\u00e9e\" tax, and therefore Tibetans were \"undertaking domestic affairs, not foreign diplomacy\". Sperling writes that the Ming simultaneously bought horses in the Kham region while fighting Tibetan tribes in Amdo and receiving Tibetan embassies in Nanjing. He also argues that the embassies of Tibetan lamas visiting the Ming court were for the most part efforts to promote commercial transactions between the lamas' large, wealthy entourage and Ming Chinese merchants and officials. Kolma\u0161 writes that while the Ming maintained a laissez-faire policy towards Tibet and limited the numbers of the Tibetan retinues, the Tibetans sought to maintain a tributary relationship with the Ming because imperial patronage", "The Guangxu Emperor died on November 14, 1908, and on November 15, 1908, Cixi also died. Rumors held that she or Yuan Shikai ordered trusted eunuchs to poison the Guangxu Emperor, and an autopsy conducted nearly a century later confirmed lethal levels of arsenic in his corpse. Puyi, the oldest son of Zaifeng, Prince Chun, and nephew to the childless Guangxu Emperor, was appointed successor at the age of two, leaving Zaifeng with the regency. This was followed by the dismissal of General Yuan Shikai from his former positions of power. In April 1911 Zaifeng created a cabinet in which there were two vice-premiers. Nonetheless, this cabinet was also known by contemporaries as \"The Royal Cabinet\" because among the thirteen cabinet members, five", "Plumage is regularly moulted; the standard plumage of a bird that has moulted after breeding is known as the \"non-breeding\" plumage, or\u2014in the Humphrey-Parkes terminology\u2014\"basic\" plumage; breeding plumages or variations of the basic plumage are known under the Humphrey-Parkes system as \"alternate\" plumages. Moulting is annual in most species, although some may have two moults a year, and large birds of prey may moult only once every few years. Moulting patterns vary across species. In passerines, flight feathers are replaced one at a time with the innermost primary being the first. When the fifth of sixth primary is replaced, the outermost tertiaries begin to drop. After the innermost tertiaries are moulted, the secondaries starting from the innermost begin to drop and this proceeds to the outer feathers (centrifugal moult). The greater primary coverts are moulted in synchrony with the primary that they overlap. A small number of species, such as", "In southeast Europe agrarian societies first appeared in the 7th millennium BC, attested by one of the earliest farming sites of Europe, discovered in Vasht\u00ebmi, southeastern Albania and dating back to 6,500 BC. Anthropomorphic figurines have been found in the Balkans from 6000 BC, and in Central Europe by c. 5800 BC (La Hoguette). Among the earliest cultural complexes of this area are the Sesklo culture in Thessaly, which later expanded in the Balkans giving rise to Star\u010devo-K\u00f6r\u00f6s (Cris), Linearbandkeramik, and Vin\u010da. Through a combination of cultural diffusion and migration of peoples, the Neolithic traditions spread west and northwards to reach northwestern Europe by around 4500 BC. The Vin\u010da culture may have created the earliest system of writing, the Vin\u010da signs, though archaeologist Shan Winn believes they most likely represented pictograms and ideograms rather than a truly developed form of writing.", "Several explanations have been offered for Yale\u2019s representation in national elections since the end of the Vietnam War. Various sources note the spirit of campus activism that has existed at Yale since the 1960s, and the intellectual influence of Reverend William Sloane Coffin on many of the future candidates. Yale President Richard Levin attributes the run to Yale\u2019s focus on creating \"a laboratory for future leaders,\" an institutional priority that began during the tenure of Yale Presidents Alfred Whitney Griswold and Kingman Brewster. Richard H. Brodhead, former dean of Yale College and now president of Duke University, stated: \"We do give very significant attention to orientation to the community in our admissions, and there is a very strong tradition of volunteerism at Yale.\" Yale historian Gaddis Smith notes \"an ethos of organized activity\" at Yale during the 20th century that led John Kerry to lead the Yale Political Union's Liberal Party, George Pataki the Conservative Party, and Joseph Lieberman to manage the Yale Daily News.

St. John's experiences milder temperatures during the winter season in comparison to other Canadian cities, and has the mildest winter for any Canadian city outside of British Columbia. Precipitation is frequent and often heavy, falling year round. On average, summer is the driest season, with only occasional thunderstorm activity, and the wettest months are from October to January, with December the wettest single month, with nearly 165 millimetres of precipitation on average. This winter precipitation maximum is quite unusual for humid continental climates, which most commonly have a late spring or early summer", "France: The torch relay leg in Paris, held on April 7, began on the first level of the Eiffel Tower and finished at the Stade Charl\u00e9ty. The relay was initially supposed to cover 28 km, but it was shortened at the demand of Chinese officials following widespread protests by pro-Tibet and human rights activists, who repeatedly attempted to disrupt, hinder or halt the procession. A scheduled ceremony at the town hall was cancelled at the request of the Chinese authorities, and, also at the request of Chinese authorities, the torch finished the relay by bus instead of being carried by athletes. Paris City officials had announced plans to greet the Olympic flame with peaceful protest when the torch was to reach the French capital. The city government attached a banner reading \"Paris defends human rights throughout", "In surveys made in Europe and the United States, green is the color most commonly associated with nature, life, health, youth, spring, hope and envy. In Europe and the U.S. green is sometimes associated with death (green has several seemingly contrary associations), sickness, or the devil, but in China its associations are very positive, as the symbol of fertility and happiness. In the Middle Ages and Renaissance, when the color of clothing showed the owner's social status, green was worn by merchants, bankers and the gentry, while red was the color of the nobility. The Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci wears green, showing she is not from a noble family; the benches in the British House of Commons are green, while those in the House of Lords are red. Green is also the traditional color of safety and permission; a green light means go ahead, a green card permits permanent", "The era saw Libya's return to the international arena. In 1999, Libya began secret talks with the British government to normalise relations. In 2001, Gaddafi condemned the September 11 attacks on the U.S. by al-Qaeda, expressing sympathy with the victims and calling for Libyan involvement in the War on Terror against militant Islamism. His government continued suppressing domestic Islamism, at the same time as Gaddafi called for the wider application of sharia law. Libya also cemented connections with China and North Korea, being visited by Chinese President Jiang Zemin in April 2002. Influenced by the events of the Iraq War, in December 2003, Libya renounced its possession of weapons of mass destruction, decommissioning its chemical and nuclear weapons programs. Relations with the U.S. improved as a result, while UK Prime Minister Tony Blair met with Gaddafi in the Libyan desert in March 2004. The following month, Gaddafi travelled to the headquarters of the European Union (EU) in Brussels, signifying improved", "Constantius, ordered Liberius into exile in 356 giving him, then, three days to comply. He was ordered into banishment to Beroea, in Thrace; Beroea (Thrace). He sent expensive presents, too, if he were to accept the Arian position but were refused. He sent him, indeed, five hundred pieces of gold \"to bear his charges\" but Liberius refused them, saying, he might bestow them on his flatters; as he did also a like present from the empress, bidding the messenger learn to believe in Christ, and not to persecute the Church of God. Attempts were made to leave the presents in The Church, but Liberius threw them out. Constantius hereupon sent for him under a strict guard to Milan, where, in a conference recorded by Theodoret, he boldly told Constantius that Athanasius had been acquitted at Sardica, and his enemies proved calumniators (see: \"calumny\") and impostors, and that it was unjust", "The College Dropout was eventually issued by Roc-A-Fella in February 2004, shooting to number two on the Billboard 200 as his debut single, \"Through the Wire\" peaked at number fifteen on the Billboard Hot 100 chart for five weeks. \"Slow Jamz\", his second single featuring Twista and Jamie Foxx, became an even bigger success: it became the three musicians' first number one hit. The College Dropout received near-universal critical acclaim from contemporary music critics, was voted the top album of the year by two major music publications, and has consistently been ranked among the great hip-hop works and debut albums by artists. \"Jesus Walks\", the album's fourth single, perhaps exposed West to a wider audience; the song's subject matter concerns faith and Christianity. The song nevertheless reached the top 20 of the Billboard pop charts, despite industry executives' predictions that a song containing such blatant declarations of faith", "The Montana Territory was formed on April 26, 1864, when the U.S. passed the Organic Act. Schools started forming in the area before it was officially a territory as families started settling into the area. The first schools were subscription schools that typically held in the teacher's home. The first formal school on record was at Fort Owen in Bitterroot valley in 1862. The students were Indian children and the children of Fort Owen employees. The first school term started in early winter and only lasted until February 28. Classes were taught by Mr. Robinson. Another early subscription school was started by Thomas Dimsdale in Virginia City in 1863. In this school students were charged $1.75 per week. The Montana Territorial Legislative Assembly had its inaugural meeting in 1864. The first legislature authorized counties to levy taxes for schools, which set the foundations for public schooling.", "The final major aspect of identity formation is self-esteem. Self-esteem is defined as one's thoughts and feelings about one's self-concept and identity. Most theories on self-esteem state that there is a grand desire, across all genders and ages, to maintain, protect and enhance their self-esteem. Contrary to popular belief, there is no empirical evidence for a significant drop in self-esteem over the course of adolescence. \"Barometric self-esteem\" fluctuates rapidly and can cause severe distress and anxiety, but baseline self-esteem remains highly stable across adolescence. The validity of global self-esteem scales has been questioned, and many suggest that more specific scales might reveal more about the adolescent experience. Girls are most likely to enjoy high self-esteem when engaged in supportive relationships with friends, the most important function of friendship to them is having someone who can provide social and moral support. When they", "The deeper ancestral demography of Bermuda's population has been obscured by the ethnic homogenisation of the last four centuries. There is effectively no ethnic distinction between black and white Bermudians, other than those characterising recent immigrant communities. In the 17th century, this was not so. For the first hundred years of settlement, white Protestants of English heritage were the distinct majority, with white minorities of Irish (the native language of many of whom can be assumed to have been Gaelic) and Scots sent to Bermuda after the English invasions of their homelands that followed the English Civil War. Non-white minorities included Spanish-speaking, free (indentured) blacks from the West Indies, black chattel slaves primarily captured from Spanish and Portuguese ships by Bermudian privateers, and Native Americans, primarily from the Algonquian and other tribes of the Atlantic seaboard, but possibly from as far away as Mexico. By the 19th century, the white ethnically-English Bermudians had lost their numerical advantage.

Apple concluded that Intel's CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer) architecture ultimately would not be able to compete against RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) processors. While the Motorola 68040 offered the same features as the Intel 80486 and could on a clock-for-clock basis significantly outperform the Intel chip, the 486 had the ability to be clocked significantly faster without suffering from overheating problems, especially the clock-doubled i486DX2 which ran the CPU logic at twice the external bus speed, giving such equipped IBM compatible systems a significant performance lead over their Macintosh equivalents. Apple's product design and engineering didn't help matters as they restricted the use of the '040 to their expensive Quadras for a time while the 486 was readily available to OEMs as well as enthusiasts who put together their own machines. In late 1991, as the higher-end Macintosh desktop lineup transitioned to the '040, Apple was unable to", "A few hard rock bands from the 1970s and 1980s managed to sustain highly successful recording careers. Bon Jovi were still able to achieve a commercial hit with \"It's My Life\" from their double platinum-certified album Crush (2000). and AC/DC released the platinum-certified Stiff Upper Lip (2000) Aerosmith released a number two platinum album, Just Push Play (2001), which saw the band foray further into pop with the Top 10 hit \"Jaded\", and a blues cover album, Honkin' on Bobo, which reached number five in 2004. Heart achieved their first Top 10 album since the early 90s with Red Velvet Car in 2010, becoming the first female-led hard rock band to earn Top 10 albums spanning five decades. There were reunions and subsequent tours from Van Halen (with Hagar in 2004 and then Roth in 2007), The Who (delayed in 2002 by the death of bassist John Entwistle until 2006) and Black Sabbath (with Osbourne 1997\u20132006 and Dio 2006\u20132010) and even a one off performance by Led Zeppelin (2007), renewing the interest in previous", "To prevent the risk of out-of-phase supplies mixing, sections of line fed from different feeder stations must be kept strictly isolated. This is achieved by Neutral Sections (also known as Phase Breaks), usually provided at feeder stations and midway between them although, typically, only half are in use at any time, the others being provided to allow a feeder station to be shut down and power provided from adjacent feeder stations. Neutral Sections usually consist of an earthed section of wire which is separated from the live wires on either side by insulating material, typically ceramic beads, designed so that the pantograph will smoothly run from one section to the other. The earthed section prevents an arc being drawn from one live section to the other, as the voltage difference may be higher than the normal system voltage if the live sections are on different phases and the protective circuit breakers may not be able to safely interrupt the considerable current that would flow. To prevent the", "Carolingian art was produced for a small group of figures around the court, and the monasteries and churches they supported. It was dominated by efforts to regain the dignity and classicism of imperial Roman and Byzantine art, but was also influenced by the Insular art of the British Isles. Insular art integrated the energy of Irish Celtic and Anglo-Saxon Germanic styles of ornament with Mediterranean forms such as the book, and established many characteristics of art for the rest of the medieval period. Surviving religious works from the Early Middle Ages are mostly illuminated manuscripts and carved ivories, originally made for metalwork that has since been melted down. Objects in precious metals were the most prestigious form of art, but almost all are lost except for a few crosses such as the Cross of Lothair, several reliquaries, and finds such as the Anglo-Saxon burial at Sutton Hoo and the hoards of Gourdon from Merovingian France, Guarrazar from Visigothic Spain and Nagyszentmikl\u00f3s near Byzantine", "Successful cultivation of cotton requires a long frost-free period, plenty of sunshine, and a moderate rainfall, usually from 600 to 1,200 mm (24 to 47 in). Soils usually need to be fairly heavy, although the level of nutrients does not need to be exceptional. In general, these conditions are met within the seasonally dry tropics and subtropics in the Northern and Southern hemispheres, but a large proportion of the cotton grown today is cultivated in areas with less rainfall that obtain the water from irrigation. Production of the crop for a given year usually starts soon after harvesting the preceding autumn. Cotton is naturally a perennial but is grown as an annual to help control pests. Planting time in spring in the Northern hemisphere varies from the beginning of February to the beginning of June. The area of the United States known as the South Plains", "The book was widely translated in Darwin's lifetime, but problems arose with translating concepts and metaphors, and some translations were biased by the translator's own agenda. Darwin distributed presentation copies in France and Germany, hoping that suitable applicants would come forward, as translators were expected to make their own arrangements with a local publisher. He welcomed the distinguished elderly naturalist and geologist Heinrich Georg Bronn, but the German translation published in 1860 imposed Bronn's own ideas, adding controversial themes that Darwin had deliberately omitted. Bronn translated \"favoured races\" as \"perfected races\", and added essays on issues including the origin of life, as well as a final chapter on religious implications partly inspired by Bronn's adherence to Naturphilosophie. In 1862, Bronn produced a second edition based on the third English edition and Darwin's suggested additions, but then died of a heart attack. Darwin corresponded closely with Julius Victor Carus, who published an improved translation in 1867. Darwin's", "Under the Capetian dynasty France slowly began to expand its authority over the nobility, growing out of the \u00cele-de-France to exert control over more of the country in the 11th and 12th centuries. They faced a powerful rival in the Dukes of Normandy, who in 1066 under William the Conqueror (duke 1035\u20131087), conquered England (r. 1066\u201387) and created a cross-channel empire that lasted, in various forms, throughout the rest of the Middle Ages. Normans also settled in Sicily and southern Italy, when Robert Guiscard (d. 1085) landed there in 1059 and established a duchy that later became the Kingdom of Sicily. Under the Angevin dynasty of Henry II (r. 1154\u201389) and his son Richard I (r. 1189\u201399), the kings of England ruled over England and large areas of France,[W] brought to the family by Henry II's", "In 2009, IGN named the Xbox 360 the sixth-greatest video game console of all time, out of a field of 25. Although not the best-selling console of the seventh-generation, the Xbox 360 was deemed by TechRadar to be the most influential, by emphasizing digital media distribution and online gaming through Xbox Live, and by popularizing game achievement awards. PC Magazine considered the Xbox 360 the prototype for online gaming as it \"proved that online gaming communities could thrive in the console space\". Five years after the Xbox 360's original debut, the well-received Kinect motion capture camera was released, which set the record of being the fastest selling consumer electronic device in history, and extended the life of the console. Edge ranked Xbox 360 the second-best console of the 1993\u20132013 period, stating \"It had its own social network, cross-game chat, new indie games every week, and the best version of just about every multiformat game...Killzone is no Halo and nowadays Gran Turismo is no Forza, but it's", "Vladimir had been prince of Novgorod when his father Sviatoslav I died in 972. He was forced to flee to Scandinavia in 976 after his half-brother Yaropolk had murdered his other brother Oleg and taken control of Rus. In Scandinavia, with the help of his relative Earl H\u00e5kon Sigurdsson, ruler of Norway, Vladimir assembled a Viking army and reconquered Novgorod and Kiev from Yaropolk. As Prince of Kiev, Vladimir's most notable achievement was the Christianization of Kievan Rus', a process that began in 988. The Primary Chronicle states that when Vladimir had decided to accept a new faith instead of the traditional idol-worship (paganism) of the Slavs, he sent out some of his most valued advisors and warriors as emissaries to different parts of Europe. They visited the Christians", "Galicia was spared the worst of the fighting in that war: it was one of the areas where the initial coup attempt at the outset of the war was successful, and it remained in Nationalist (Franco's army's) hands throughout the war. While there were no pitched battles, there was repression and death: all political parties were abolished, as were all labor unions and Galician nationalist organizations as the Seminario de Estudos Galegos. Galicia's statute of autonomy was annulled (as were those of Catalonia and the Basque provinces once those were conquered). According to Carlos Fern\u00e1ndez Santander, at least 4,200 people were killed either extrajudicially or after summary trials, among them republicans, communists, Galician nationalists, socialists and anarchists. Victims included the civil governors of all four Galician provinces; Juana Capdevielle, the wife of the governor of A Coru\u00f1a; mayors such as \u00c1nxel Casal of Santiago de Compostela, of the Partido Galeguista; prominent socialists", "Most fatty acids are non-essential, meaning the body can produce them as needed, generally from other fatty acids and always by expending energy to do so. However, in humans, at least two fatty acids are essential and must be included in the diet. An appropriate balance of essential fatty acids\u2014omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids\u2014seems also important for health, although definitive experimental demonstration has been elusive. Both of these \"omega\" long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids are substrates for a class of eicosanoids known as prostaglandins, which have roles throughout the human body. They are hormones, in some respects. The omega-3 eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), which can be made in the human body from the omega-3 essential fatty acid alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), or taken in through marine food sources, serves as a building block for series 3 prostaglandins (e.g., weakly inflammatory PGE3). The omega-6 dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA) serves as a building block for series 1", "Public priests were appointed by the collegia. Once elected, a priest held permanent religious authority from the eternal divine, which offered him lifetime influence, privilege and immunity. Therefore, civil and religious law limited the number and kind of religious offices allowed an individual and his family. Religious law was collegial and traditional; it informed political decisions, could overturn them, and was difficult to exploit for personal gain. Priesthood was a costly honour: in traditional Roman practice, a priest drew no stipend. Cult donations were the property of the deity, whose priest must provide cult regardless of shortfalls in public funding \u2013 this could mean subsidy of acolytes and all other cult maintenance from personal funds. For those who had reached their goal in the Cursus honorum, permanent priesthood was best sought or granted after a lifetime's service in military or political life, or preferably both:", "On April 4, 2008, Beyonc\u00e9 married Jay Z. She publicly revealed their marriage in a video montage at the listening party for her third studio album, I Am... Sasha Fierce, in Manhattan's Sony Club on October 22, 2008. I Am... Sasha Fierce was released on November 18, 2008 in the United States. The album formally introduces Beyonc\u00e9's alter ego Sasha Fierce, conceived during the making of her 2003 single \"Crazy in Love\", selling 482,000 copies in its first week, debuting atop the Billboard 200, and giving Beyonc\u00e9 her third consecutive number-one album in the US. The album featured the number-one song \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\" and the top-five songs \"If I Were a Boy\" and \"Halo\".

It enclosed twenty pages describing an evolutionary mechanism, a response to Darwin's recent encouragement, with a request to send it on to Lyell if Darwin thought it worthwhile. The mechanism was similar to Darwin's own theory. Darwin wrote to Lyell that \"your words have come true with a vengeance, ... forestalled\" and he would \"of course, at once write and offer to send [it] to any journal\" that Wallace chose, adding that \"all my originality, whatever it may amount to, will be smashed\". Lyell and Hooker agreed that a joint publication putting together Wallace's pages with extracts from Darwin's 1844 Essay and his 1857 letter to Gray should be presented at the Linnean Society, and on 1 July 1858, the papers entitled On the Tendency", "In the greater metropolitan area, 13% of the population live below the poverty line.

The most common of these is the ladder match. In the basic ladder match, the wrestlers or teams of wrestlers must climb a ladder to obtain a prize that is hoisted above the ring. The key to winning this match is that the wrestler or team of wrestlers must try to incapacitate each other long enough for one wrestler to climb the ladder and secure that prize for their team. As a result, the ladder can be used as a weapon. The prizes include \u2013 but are not limited to any given championship belt (the traditional prize), a document granting the winner the right to a future title shot, or any document that matters to the wrestlers involved in the match (such as one granting the winner a cash prize). Another common specialty match is known as the battle royal. In a battle royal, all the wrestlers enter the ring to the point that there are 20-30 wrestlers in the ring at one time. When the match begins, the simple", "After Cassander's death in 298 BCE, however, Demetrius, who still maintained a sizable loyal army and fleet, invaded Macedon, seized the Macedonian throne (294) and conquered Thessaly and most of central Greece (293-291). He was defeated in 288 BC when Lysimachus of Thrace and Pyrrhus of Epirus invaded Macedon on two fronts, and quickly carved up the kingdom for themselves. Demetrius fled to central Greece with his mercenaries and began to build support there and in the northern Peloponnese. He once again laid siege to Athens after they turned on him, but then struck a treaty with the Athenians and Ptolemy, which allowed him to cross over to Asia minor and wage war on Lysimachus' holdings in Ionia, leaving his son Antigonus Gonatas in Greece. After initial successes, he was forced to surrender to Seleucus in 285 and later died in captivity. Lysimachus, who", "The first significant work that expressed scientific theory and knowledge expressly for the laity, in the vernacular, and with the entertainment of readers in mind, was Bernard de Fontenelle's Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds (1686). The book was produced specifically for women with an interest in scientific writing and inspired a variety of similar works. These popular works were written in a discursive style, which was laid out much more clearly for the reader than the complicated articles, treatises, and books published by the academies and scientists. Charles Leadbetter's Astronomy (1727) was advertised as \"a Work entirely New\" that would include \"short and easie [sic] Rules and Astronomical Tables.\" The first French introduction to Newtonianism and the Principia was El\u00e9ments de la philosophie de Newton, published by Voltaire in 1738. \u00c9milie du Ch\u00e2telet's translation of the Principia, published after her death in 1756, also helped to spread Newton's theories beyond scientific academies and the university.

Arabic replaced Persian as the official language, while Persian remained the language of both ordinary people and of literature. Iran became a major contributor to the Islamic Golden Age, producing many influential scientists, scholars, artists, and thinkers. Establishment of the Safavid Dynasty in 1501, converted the Iranian people from Sunni Islam to Twelver Shia Islam, and made Twelver Shia Islam the official religion of Iran. Safavid conversion of Iran from Sunnism to Shiism marked one of the most important turning points in Iranian and Muslim history. Starting in 1736 under Nader Shah, Iran reached its greatest territorial extent since the Sassanid Empire, briefly possessing what was arguably the most powerful empire at the time. During the 19th century, Iran irrevocably lost swaths of its territories in the Caucasus which made part of the concept of Iran for centuries, to neighboring Imperial Russia. Popular unrest culminated in", "A government report covered by the Guardian in 2002 indicates that between 1940 and 1979, the Ministry of Defence \"turned large parts of the country into a giant laboratory to conduct a series of secret germ warfare tests on the public\" and many of these tests \"involved releasing potentially dangerous chemicals and micro-organisms over vast swaths of the population without the public being told.\" The Ministry of Defence claims that these trials were to simulate germ warfare and that the tests were harmless. Still, families who have been in the area of many of the tests are experiencing children with birth defects and physical and mental handicaps and many are asking for a public inquiry. According to the report these tests affected estimated millions of people including one period between 1961 and 1968 where \"more than a million people along the south coast of England, from Torquay to the New Forest, were exposed to bacteria including e.coli and bacillus globigii, which mimics anthrax.\" Two", "The opening years of the 1980s saw a number of changes in personnel and direction of established hard rock acts, including the deaths of Bon Scott, the lead singer of AC/DC, and John Bonham, drummer with Led Zeppelin. Whereas Zeppelin broke up almost immediately afterwards, AC/DC pressed on, recording the album Back in Black (1980) with their new lead singer, Brian Johnson. It became the fifth-highest-selling album of all time in the US and the second-highest-selling album in the world. Black Sabbath had split with original singer Ozzy Osbourne in 1979 and replaced him with Ronnie James Dio, formerly of Rainbow, giving the band a new sound and a period of creativity and popularity beginning with Heaven and Hell (1980). Osbourne embarked on a solo career with Blizzard of Ozz (1980), featuring American guitarist Randy Rhoads. Some bands, such as Queen, moved away from their hard rock roots and more towards pop rock, while others, including", "From his diagrams of a small number of particles interacting in spacetime, Feynman could then model all of physics in terms of the spins of those particles and the range of coupling of the fundamental forces. Feynman attempted an explanation of the strong interactions governing nucleons scattering called the parton model. The parton model emerged as a complement to the quark model developed by his Caltech colleague Murray Gell-Mann. The relationship between the two models was murky; Gell-Mann referred to Feynman's partons derisively as \"put-ons\". In the mid-1960s, physicists believed that quarks were just a bookkeeping device for symmetry numbers, not real particles, as the statistics of the Omega-minus particle, if it were interpreted as three identical strange quarks bound together, seemed impossible if quarks were real. The Stanford linear accelerator deep inelastic scattering experiments of the late 1960s showed, analogously to Ernest Rutherford's experiment of scattering alpha particles on gold nuclei in", "On December 13, 2013, Beyonc\u00e9 unexpectedly released her eponymous fifth studio album on the iTunes Store without any prior announcement or promotion. The album debuted atop the Billboard 200 chart, giving Beyonc\u00e9 her fifth consecutive number-one album in the US. This made her the first woman in the chart's history to have her first five studio albums debut at number one. Beyonc\u00e9 received critical acclaim and commercial success, selling one million digital copies worldwide in six days; The New York Times noted the album's unconventional, unexpected release as significant. Musically an electro-R&B album, it concerns darker themes previously unexplored in her work, such as \"bulimia, postnatal depression [and] the fears and insecurities of marriage and motherhood\". The single \"Drunk in Love\", featuring Jay Z, peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.

It served as the couple's first", "Before the early 20th century, treatments for infections were based primarily on medicinal folklore. Mixtures with antimicrobial properties that were used in treatments of infections were described over 2000 years ago. Many ancient cultures, including the ancient Egyptians and ancient Greeks, used specially selected mold and plant materials and extracts to treat infections. More recent observations made in the laboratory of antibiosis between microorganisms led to the discovery of natural antibacterials produced by microorganisms. Louis Pasteur observed, \"if we could intervene in the antagonism observed between some bacteria, it would offer perhaps the greatest hopes for therapeutics\". The term 'antibiosis', meaning \"against life\", was introduced by the French bacteriologist Jean Paul Vuillemin as a descriptive name of the phenomenon exhibited by these early antibacterial drugs. Antibiosis was first described in 1877 in bacteria when Louis Pasteur", "More commonly, in cases where there are three or more parties, no one party is likely to gain power alone, and parties work with each other to form coalition governments. This has been an emerging trend in the politics of the Republic of Ireland since the 1980s and is almost always the case in Germany on national and state level, and in most constituencies at the communal level. Furthermore, since the forming of the Republic of Iceland there has never been a government not led by a coalition (usually of the Independence Party and one other (often the Social Democratic Alliance). A similar situation exists in the Republic of Ireland; since 1989, no one party has held power on its own. Since then, numerous coalition governments have been formed. These coalitions have been exclusively led by one of either Fianna F\u00e1il or Fine Gael.

On the day of the event, the Speaker of the Senate will read to the chamber a notice from the secretary to the governor general indicating when the viceroy or a deputy thereof will arrive. The Senate thereafter cannot adjourn until after the ceremony. The speaker moves to sit beside the throne, the Mace Bearer, with mace in hand, stands adjacent to him or her, and the governor general enters to take the speaker's chair. The Usher of the Black Rod is then commanded by the speaker to summon the Members of Parliament, who follow Black Rod back to the Senate, the Sergeant-at-Arms carrying the mace of the House of Commons. In the Senate, those from the commons stand behind the bar, while Black Rod proceeds to stand next to the governor general, who then nods his or her head to signify Royal Assent to the presented bills (which do not include appropriations bills).

The subsequent 17th century was one of political upheaval, religious division and war. English colonialism in Ireland of the 16th century was extended by large-scale Scottish and English colonies in Ulster. Religious division heightened and the King in England came into conflict with parliament. A prime issue was, inter alia, over his policy of tolerance towards Catholicism. The resulting English Civil War or War of the Three Kingdoms led to a revolutionary republic in England. Ireland, largely Catholic was mainly loyal to the king. Following defeat to the parliaments army, large scale land distributions from loyalist Irish nobility to English commoners in the service of the parliamentary army created the beginnings a new Ascendancy class which over the next hundred years would obliterate the English (Hiberno-Norman) and Gaelic Irish", "By the early 18th century, the Maratha Kingdom had transformed itself into the Maratha Empire under the rule of the Peshwas (prime ministers). In 1737, the Marathas defeated a Mughal army in their capital, Delhi itself in Battle of Delhi (1737). The Marathas continued their military campaigns against Mughals, Nizam, Nawab of Bengal and Durrani Empire to further extend their boundaries. Gordon explained how the Maratha systematically took control over new regions. They would start with annual raids, followed by collecting ransom from villages and towns while the declining Mughal Empire retained nominal control and finally taking over the region. He explained it with the example of Malwa region. Marathas built an efficient system of public administration known for its attention to detail. It succeeded in raising revenue in districts that recovered from years of raids, up to levels previously enjoyed by", "In 1939, the Bureau began compiling a custodial detention list with the names of those who would be taken into custody in the event of war with Axis nations. The majority of the names on the list belonged to Issei community leaders, as the FBI investigation built on an existing Naval Intelligence index that had focused on Japanese Americans in Hawaii and the West Coast, but many German and Italian nationals also found their way onto the secret list. Robert Shivers, head of the Honolulu office, obtained permission from Hoover to start detaining those on the list on December 7, 1941, while bombs were still falling over Pearl Harbor. Mass arrests and searches of homes (in most cases conducted without warrants) began a few hours after the attack, and over the next several weeks more than 5,500 Issei men were taken into FBI custody. On February 19, 1942, President Franklin Roosevelt issued Executive Order 9066, authorizing the removal of Japanese Americans from the West Coast. FBI Director Hoover opposed the", "The body\u2019s capability to react to antigen depends on a person's age, antigen type, maternal factors and the area where the antigen is presented. Neonates are said to be in a state of physiological immunodeficiency, because both their innate and adaptive immunological responses are greatly suppressed. Once born, a child\u2019s immune system responds favorably to protein antigens while not as well to glycoproteins and polysaccharides. In fact, many of the infections acquired by neonates are caused by low virulence organisms like Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas. In neonates, opsonic activity and the ability to activate the complement cascade is very limited. For example, the mean level of C3 in a newborn is approximately 65% of that found in the adult. Phagocytic activity is also greatly impaired in newborns. This is due to lower opsonic activity, as well as diminished up-regulation of integrin and selectin receptors, which limit the ability of neutrophils to interact with adhesion molecules in the endothelium.

The relay descended into confusion as the first runner in the elaborately planned relay disappeared into a warehouse on a waterfront pier where it stayed for a half-an-hour. There were clashes between thousands of pro-China demonstrators, many of whom said they were bused in by the Chinese Consulate and other pro-China groups, and both pro-Tibet and Darfur protesters. The non-Chinese demonstrators were reported to have been swamped and trailed by angry crowds. Around 2 pm PDT (21:00 UTC), the torch resurfaced about 3 km (1.9 mi) away from the stadium along Van Ness Avenue, a heavily trafficked thoroughfare that was not on official route plans. Television reports showed the flame", "A standard adult football match consists of two periods of 45 minutes each, known as halves. Each half runs continuously, meaning that the clock is not stopped when the ball is out of play. There is usually a 15-minute half-time break between halves. The end of the match is known as full-time. The referee is the official timekeeper for the match, and may make an allowance for time lost through substitutions, injured players requiring attention, or other stoppages. This added time is called additional time in FIFA documents, but is most commonly referred to as stoppage time or injury time, while loss time can also be used as a synonym. The duration of stoppage time is at the sole discretion of the referee. The referee alone signals the end of the match. In matches where a fourth official is appointed, toward the end of the half the referee signals how many minutes of stoppage time he intends to add. The fourth official then informs the players and spectators by holding up a board", "There is usually an indication for a specific identification of an infectious agent only when such identification can aid in the treatment or prevention of the disease, or to advance knowledge of the course of an illness prior to the development of effective therapeutic or preventative measures. For example, in the early 1980s, prior to the appearance of AZT for the treatment of AIDS, the course of the disease was closely followed by monitoring the composition of patient blood samples, even though the outcome would not offer the patient any further treatment options. In part, these studies on the appearance of HIV in specific communities permitted the advancement of hypotheses as to the route of transmission of the virus. By understanding how the disease was transmitted, resources could be targeted to the communities at greatest risk in campaigns aimed at reducing the number of new infections. The specific serological diagnostic identification, and later genotypic or molecular identification, of HIV also enabled the development of hypotheses as to the temporal and geographical origins", "Since re-establishing independence, Estonia has styled itself as the gateway between East and West and aggressively pursued economic reform and integration with the West. Estonia's market reforms put it among the economic leaders in the former COMECON area.[citation needed] In 1994, based on the economic theories of Milton Friedman, Estonia became one of the first countries to adopt a flat tax, with a uniform rate of 26% regardless of personal income. In January 2005, the personal income tax rate was reduced to 24%. Another reduction to 23% followed in January 2006. The income tax rate was decreased to 21% by January 2008. The Government of Estonia finalised the design of Estonian euro coins in late 2004, and adopted the euro as the country's currency on 1 January 2011, later than planned due to continued high inflation.

Coastal areas are covered in volcanic rock and warmer and drier than the centre. The highest point of the island is Diana's Peak at 818 m (2,684 ft). In 1996 it became the island's first national park. Much of the island is covered by New Zealand flax, a legacy of former industry, but there are some original trees augmented by plantations, including those of the Millennium Forest project which was established in 2002 to replant part of the lost Great Wood and is now managed by the Saint Helena National Trust. When the island was discovered, it was covered with unique indigenous vegetation, including a remarkable cabbage tree species.

After an 8-year separation, Deep Purple returned with the classic Machine Head line-up to produce Perfect Strangers (1984), which reached number five in the UK, hit the top five in five other countries, and was a platinum-seller in the US. After somewhat slower sales of its fourth album, Fair Warning, Van Halen rebounded with the Top 3 album Diver Down in 1982, then reached their commercial pinnacle with 1984. It reached number two on the Billboard album chart and provided the track \"Jump\", which reached number one on the singles chart and remained there for several weeks.

Since a conservative (such as the Republican Party) and liberal (such as the Democratic Party) party has usually been the status quo within American politics. The first parties were called Federalist and Republican, followed by a brief period of Republican dominance before a split occurred between National Republicans and Democratic Republicans. The former became the Whig Party and the latter became the Democratic Party. The Whigs survived only for two decades before they split over the spread of slavery, those opposed becoming members of the new Republican Party, as did anti-slavery members of the Democratic Party. Third parties (such as the Libertarian Party) often receive little support and are very rarely the victors in elections. Despite this, there have been several examples of third parties siphoning votes from major parties that were expected to win (such as Theodore Roosevelt in the election of 1912 and George Wallace in the election of 1968).", "Notre Dame's conference affiliations for all of its sports except football and fencing changed in July 2013 as a result of major conference realignment, and its fencing affiliation will change in July 2014. The Irish left the Big East for the ACC during a prolonged period of instability in the Big East; while they maintain their football independence, they have committed to play five games per season against ACC opponents. In ice hockey, the Irish were forced to find a new conference home after the Big Ten Conference's decision to add the sport in 2013\u201314 led to a cascade of conference moves that culminated in the dissolution of the school's former hockey home, the Central Collegiate Hockey Association, after the 2012\u201313 season.

Francesca Martinez and Richard Vaughan refused to carry the torch, while Konnie Huq decided to carry it and also speak out against China. The pro-Tibetan Member of Parliament Norman Baker asked all bearers to reconsider. Amid pressure from both directions, Prime Minister Gordon Brown welcomed the torch outside 10 Downing Street without holding or touching it. The London relay saw the torch surrounded by what the BBC described as \"a mobile protective ring.\" Protests began as soon as Redgrave started the event, leading to at least thirty-five arrests. In Ladbroke Grove a demonstrator attempted to snatch the torch from Konnie Huq in a momentary struggle, and in a separate incident, a fire extinguisher was set off near the torch.

Other locations of religious importance in Israel are Nazareth (holy in Christianity as the site of the Annunciation of Mary), Tiberias and Safed (two of the Four Holy Cities in Judaism), the White Mosque in Ramla (holy in Islam as the shrine of the prophet Saleh), and the Church of Saint George in Lod (holy in Christianity and Islam as the tomb of Saint George or Al Khidr). A number of other religious landmarks are located in the West Bank, among them Joseph's Tomb in Nablus, the birthplace of Jesus and Rachel's Tomb in Bethlehem, and", "Many of the non-alphanumeric characters were positioned to correspond to their shifted position on typewriters; an important subtlety is that these were based on mechanical typewriters, not electric typewriters.

This was accommodated by removing _ (underscore) from", "Adolescence marks a rapid change in one's role within a family. Young children tend to assert themselves forcefully, but are unable to demonstrate much influence over family decisions until early adolescence, when they are increasingly viewed by parents as equals. The adolescent faces the task of increasing independence while preserving a caring relationship with his or her parents. When children go through puberty, there is often a significant increase in parent\u2013child conflict and a less cohesive familial bond. Arguments often concern minor issues of control, such as curfew, acceptable clothing, and the adolescent's right to privacy, which adolescents may have previously viewed as issues over which their parents had complete authority. Parent-adolescent disagreement also increases as friends demonstrate a greater impact on one another, new influences on the adolescent that may be in opposition to parents' values. Social media has also played an increasing role in adolescent and parent disagreements. While parents never had to worry about the threats of social", "Microbiological culture is a principal tool used to diagnose infectious disease. In a microbial culture, a growth medium is provided for a specific agent. A sample taken from potentially diseased tissue or fluid is then tested for the presence of an infectious agent able to grow within that medium. Most pathogenic bacteria are easily grown on nutrient agar, a form of solid medium that supplies carbohydrates and proteins necessary for growth of a bacterium, along with copious amounts of water. A single bacterium will grow into a visible mound on the surface of the plate called a colony, which may be separated from other colonies or melded together into a \"lawn\". The size, color, shape and form of a colony is characteristic of the bacterial species, its specific genetic makeup (its strain), and the environment that supports its growth. Other ingredients are often added to the plate to aid in identification. Plates may contain substances that permit the growth of some bacteria", "About 20% of pupils at Eton receive financial support, through a range of bursaries and scholarships. The recent Head Master, Tony Little, said that Eton is developing plans to allow any boy to attend the school whatever his parents' income and, in 2011, said that around 250 boys received \"significant\" financial help from the school. In early 2014, this figure had risen to 263 pupils receiving the equivalent of around 60% of school fee assistance, whilst a further 63 received their education free of charge. Little said that, in the short term, he wanted to ensure that around 320 pupils per year receive bursaries, and that 70 were educated free of charge, with the intention that the number of pupils", "Before forming Queen, Brian May and Roger Taylor had played together in a band named Smile. Freddie Mercury (then known by his birth name of Farrokh \"Freddie\" Bulsara) was a fan of Smile and encouraged them to experiment with more elaborate stage and recording techniques. Mercury joined the band in 1970, suggested \"Queen\" as a new band name, and adopted his familiar stage name. John Deacon was recruited prior to recording their eponymous debut album in 1973. Queen first charted in the UK with their second album, Queen II, in 1974, but it was the release of Sheer Heart Attack later that year and A Night at the Opera in 1975 which brought them international success. The latter featured \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", which stayed at number one in the UK for nine weeks and popularised the music video. Their 1977 album, News of the World, contained \"We Will Rock You\" and \"We Are the Champions\", which have become anthems at sporting", "On 13 March, the upper Clyde port of Clydebank near Glasgow was bombed. All but seven of its 12,000 houses were damaged. Many more ports were attacked. Plymouth was attacked five times before the end of the month while Belfast, Hull, and Cardiff were hit. Cardiff was bombed on three nights, Portsmouth centre was devastated by five raids. The rate of civilian housing lost was averaging 40,000 people per week dehoused in September 1940. In March 1941, two raids on Plymouth and London dehoused 148,000 people. Still, while heavily damaged, British ports continued to support war industry and supplies from North America continued to pass through them while the Royal Navy continued to operate in Plymouth, Southampton, and Portsmouth. Plymouth in particular, because of its vulnerable position on the south coast and close proximity to German air bases, was subjected to the heaviest attacks. On 10/11 March, 240 bombers dropped 193 tons of high explosives and 46,000 incendiaries. Many houses and commercial centres were heavily", "It is not clear exactly where collegiate a cappella began. The Rensselyrics of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (formerly known as the RPI Glee Club), established in 1873 is perhaps the oldest known collegiate a cappella group.[citation needed] However the longest continuously-singing group is probably The Whiffenpoofs of Yale University, which was formed in 1909 and once included Cole Porter as a member. Collegiate a cappella groups grew throughout the 20th century. Some notable historical groups formed along the way include Princeton University's Tigertones (1946), Colgate University's The Colgate 13 (1942), Dartmouth College's Aires (1946), Cornell University's Cayuga's Waiters (1949) and The Hangovers (1968), the University of Maine Maine Steiners (1958), the Columbia University Kingsmen (1949), the Jabberwocks of Brown University (1949), and the University of Rochester YellowJackets (1956). All-women a cappella groups followed shortly, frequently as a parody of the men's groups: the Smiffenpoofs of Smith College (1936), The Shwiffs of Connecticut College (The", "Communication within peer groups allows adolescents to explore their feelings and identity as well as develop and evaluate their social skills. Peer groups offer members the opportunity to develop social skills such as empathy, sharing, and leadership. Adolescents choose peer groups based on characteristics similarly found in themselves. By utilizing these relationships, adolescents become more accepting of who they are becoming. Group norms and values are incorporated into an adolescent\u2019s own self-concept. Through developing new communication skills and reflecting upon those of their peers, as well as self-opinions and values, an adolescent can share and express emotions and other concerns without fear of rejection or judgment. Peer groups can have positive influences on an individual, such as on academic motivation and performance. However, while peers may facilitate social development for one another they may also hinder it. Peers can have negative influences, such as encouraging experimentation with drugs, drinking, vandalism, and stealing through peer pressure. Susceptibility to peer pressure increases during early adolescence, peaks around age 14, and declines thereafter.

Claudia Durst Johnson writes that \"a greater volume of critical readings has been amassed by two legal scholars in law journals than by all the literary scholars in literary journals\". The opening quote by the 19th-century essayist Charles Lamb reads: \"Lawyers, I suppose, were children once.\" Johnson notes that even in Scout and Jem's childhood world, compromises and treaties are struck with each other by spitting on one's palm and laws are discussed by Atticus and his children: is it right that Bob Ewell hunts and traps out of season?

At the time, it was the most expensive album ever produced. Like its predecessor, the album features diverse musical styles and experimentation with stereo sound. In \"The Prophet's Song\", an eight-minute epic, the middle section is a canon, with simple phrases layered to create a full-choral sound. The Mercury penned ballad, \"Love of My Life\", featured a harp and overdubbed vocal harmonies. The album was very successful in Britain, and went triple platinum in the United States. The British public voted it the 13th greatest album of all time in a 2004 Channel 4 poll. It has also ranked highly in international polls; in a worldwide Guinness poll, it was voted the 19th greatest of all time, while an ABC poll saw the Australian public vote it the 28th greatest of all time. A Night at the Opera has frequently", "Although the doctrine of Mary's Immaculate Conception appears only later among Latin (and particularly Frankish) theologians, it became ever more manifest among Byzantine theologians reliant on Gregory Nazianzen's Mariology in the Medieval or Byzantine East. Although hymnographers and scholars, like the Emperor Justinian I, were accustomed to call Mary \"prepurified\" in their poetic and credal statements, the first point of departure for more fully commenting on Nazianzen's meaning occurs in Sophronius of Jerusalem. In other places Sophronius explains that the Theotokos was already immaculate, when she was \"purified\" at the Annunciation and goes so far as to note that John the Baptist is literally \"holier than all 'Men' born of woman\" since Mary's surpassing holiness signifies that she was holier than even John after his sanctification in utero. Sophronius' teaching is augmented and incorporated by St. John Damascene (d. 749/750). John, besides many passages wherein he extolls the Theotokos for her purification at the Annunciation, grants her the unique honor of \"purifying the waters of baptism by touching them.\" This", "There were several protests along the torch relay route. Members of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China, including pro-democracy activist Szeto Wah, waved novelty inflatable plastic Olympic flames, which they said symbolised democracy. They wanted accountability for the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 and the implementation of democracy in Hong Kong. Political activist and Legislative Council member Leung Kwok-hung (Longhair) also joined the protest, saying \"I'm very proud that in Hong Kong we still have people brave enough to speak out.\" Pro-democracy activists were overwhelmed by a crowd of torch supporters with insults like \"running dog,\" \"traitor,\" \"get out!,\" and \"I love the Communist Party.\" At the same time, about 10 members of the Civil Human Rights Front had orange banners calling for human rights improvements and universal suffrage. Onlookers were saying \"Aren't you Chinese?\" in Mandarin putonghua as they tried to cover the orange banners with a large Chinese national flag.

In recent years Zhejiang has followed its own development model, dubbed the \"Zhejiang model\", which is based on prioritizing and encouraging entrepreneurship, an emphasis on small businesses responsive to the whims of the market, large public investments into infrastructure, and the production of low-cost goods in bulk for both domestic consumption and export. As a result, Zhejiang has made itself one of the richest provinces, and the \"Zhejiang spirit\" has become something of a legend within China. However, some economists now worry that this model is not sustainable, in that it is inefficient and places unreasonable demands on raw materials and public utilities, and also a dead end, in that the myriad small businesses in Zhejiang producing cheap goods in bulk are unable to move to more sophisticated or technologically more advanced industries.", "In December, Beyonc\u00e9 along with a variety of other celebrities teamed up and produced a video campaign for \"Demand A Plan\", a bipartisan effort by a group of 950 US mayors and others designed to influence the federal government into rethinking its gun control laws, following the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. Beyonc\u00e9 became an ambassador for the 2012 World Humanitarian Day campaign donating her song \"I Was Here\" and its music video, shot in the UN, to the campaign. In 2013, it was announced that Beyonc\u00e9 would work with Salma Hayek and Frida Giannini on a Gucci \"Chime for Change\" campaign that aims to spread female empowerment.

Galicia was incorporated into the Roman Empire at the end of the Cantabrian Wars in 19 BC, being turned into a Roman province in the 3rd century AD. In 410, the Germanic Suebi established a kingdom with its capital in Braga (Portugal) which was incorporated into that of the Visigoths in 585. In 711, the Arabs invaded the Iberian Peninsula, taking the Visigoth kingdom, but soon in 740 Galicia was incorporated into the Christian kingdom of Asturias.

Game Informer called it \"so creative that it rivals the best that Hollywood has to offer\". GamesRadar praised Twilight Princess as \"a game that deserves nothing but the absolute highest recommendation\". Cubed3 hailed Twilight Princess as \"the single greatest videogame experience\". Twilight Princess's graphics were praised for the art style and animation, although the game was designed for the GameCube, which is technically lacking compared to the next generation consoles. Both IGN and GameSpy pointed out the existence of blurry textures and low-resolution characters. Despite these complaints, Computer and Video Games felt the game's atmosphere was superior to that of any previous Zelda game, and regarded Twilight Princess's Hyrule as the best version ever created. PALGN praised the game's cinematics, noting that \"the cutscenes are the best", "The islands are at relatively low altitudes, with central Ireland and southern Great Britain particularly low lying: the lowest point in the islands is Holme, Cambridgeshire at \u22122.75 m (\u22129.02 ft).

Much of Europe, a continent that had dominated the world for several centuries, was in ruins, and host to the armies of the United States and the Soviet Union, who now held the balance of global power. Britain was left essentially bankrupt, with insolvency only averted in 1946 after the negotiation of a $US 4.33 billion loan (US$56 billion in 2012) from the United States, the last instalment of which was repaid in 2006. At the same time, anti-colonial movements were on the rise in the colonies of European nations. The situation was complicated further by the increasing Cold War rivalry of the United States and the Soviet Union. In principle, both nations were opposed to European colonialism. In practice, however, American anti-communism prevailed over anti-imperialism, and therefore the United States supported the continued existence of the British Empire to keep Communist expansion in", "Homer refers to the \"Hellenes\" (/\u02c8h\u025bli\u02d0nz/) as a relatively small tribe settled in Thessalic Phthia, with its warriors under the command of Achilleus.

In Greek mythology, Hellen, the patriarch of Hellenes, was son of Pyrrha and Deucalion, who ruled around Phthia, the only survivors after the great deluge. It seems that the myth was invented when the Greek tribes started to separate from each other in certain areas of Greece and it indicates their common origin.

With the German occupation of Western Europe, the intensification of submarine and air attack on Britain's sea communications was feared by the British. Such an event would have serious consequences on the future course of the war, should the Germans succeed.

Air attacks sank 39,126 long tons (39,754 t) of shipping, with another 111,601 long tons (113,392 t) damaged. Minister of Home Security Herbert Morrison was also worried morale was breaking, noting the defeatism expressed by civilians. Other sources point to half of the port's 144 berths rendered unusable, while cargo unloading capability was reduced by 75%. Roads and railways were blocked and ships could not leave harbour.

This new, refaced principal fa\u00e7ade (of Portland stone) was designed to be the backdrop to the Victoria Memorial, a large memorial statue of Queen Victoria, placed outside the main gates. George V, who had succeeded Edward VII in 1910, had a more serious personality than his father; greater emphasis was now placed on official entertaining and royal duties than on lavish parties. He arranged a series of command performances featuring jazz musicians such as the Original Dixieland Jazz Band (1919) \u2013 the first jazz performance for a head of state, Sidney Bechet, and Louis Armstrong (1932), which earned the palace a nomination in 2009 for a (Kind of) Blue Plaque by the Brecon Jazz Festival as one of the venues making the greatest contribution to jazz music in the United Kingdom.", "The brief peace in Europe allowed Napoleon to focus on the French colonies abroad. Saint-Domingue had managed to acquire a high level of political autonomy during the Revolutionary Wars, with Toussaint Louverture installing himself as de facto dictator by 1801. Napoleon saw his chance to recuperate the formerly wealthy colony when he signed the Treaty of Amiens. During the Revolution, the National Convention voted to abolish slavery in February 1794. Under the terms of Amiens, however, Napoleon agreed to appease British demands by not abolishing slavery in any colonies where the 1794 decree had never been implemented. The resulting Law of 20 May never applied to colonies like Guadeloupe or Guyane, even though rogue generals and other officials used the pretext of peace as an opportunity to reinstate slavery in some of these places. The Law of 20 May officially restored the slave trade to the Caribbean colonies, not slavery itself. Napoleon sent an expedition under General Leclerc designed to", "Mary's complete sinlessness and concomitant exemption from any taint from the first moment of her existence was a doctrine familiar to Greek theologians of Byzantium. Beginning with St. Gregory Nazianzen, his explanation of the \"purification\" of Jesus and Mary at the circumcision (Luke 2:22) prompted him to consider the primary meaning of \"purification\" in Christology (and by extension in Mariology) to refer to a perfectly sinless nature that manifested itself in glory in a moment of grace (e.g., Jesus at his Baptism). St. Gregory Nazianzen designated Mary as \"prokathartheisa (prepurified).\" Gregory likely attempted to solve the riddle of the Purification of Jesus and Mary in the Temple through considering the human natures of Jesus and Mary as equally holy and therefore both purified in this manner of grace and glory. Gregory's doctrines surrounding Mary's purification were likely related to the burgeoning commemoration of the Mother of God in and around Constantinople very close to the date of Christmas. Nazianzen's title of Mary at the Annunciation as \"prepurified\" was subsequently adopted", "The state seemed at relative calm compared to the rest of the country due to its close ties to the United States until 1841. In 1843 the possibility of war was anticipated by the state government and it began to reinforce the defense lines along the political boundary with Texas. Supplies of weapons were sent to fully equip the military and took steps to improve efficiency at the presidios. Later, the Regimen for the Defenders of the Border were organized by the state which were made up of: light cavalry, four squads of two brigades, and a small force of 14 men and 42 officials at the price of 160,603 pesos per year. During the beginning of the 1840s, private citizens took it upon themselves to stop the commercial caravans of supplies from the United States, but being so far away from the large suppliers in central Mexico the caravan was allowed to continue in March 1844. Continuing to anticipate a war, the state legislature on July 11, 1846 by decree enlisted 6,000 men to", "In the spring of 1800, Napoleon and his troops crossed the Swiss Alps into Italy, aiming to surprise the Austrian armies that had reoccupied the peninsula when Napoleon was still in Egypt.[note 5] After a difficult crossing over the Alps, the French army entered the plains of Northern Italy virtually unopposed. While one French army approached from the north, the Austrians were busy with another stationed in Genoa, which was besieged by a substantial force. The fierce resistance of this French army, under Andr\u00e9 Mass\u00e9na, gave the northern striking force precious time to carry out their operations with little interference. After spending several days looking for each other, the two armies finally collided at the Battle of Marengo on June 14. General Melas had a numerical advantage, fielding about 30,000 Austrian soldiers while Napoleon commanded 24,000 French troops. The battle began favorably for the Austrians as their initial attack surprised the French and gradually drove them back.

The myth of Danaus, whose origin is Egypt, is a foundation legend of Argos. His daughters Danaides, were forced in Tartarus to carry a jug to fill a bathtub without a bottom. This myth is connected with a task that can never be fulfilled (Sisyphos) and the name can be derived from the PIE root *danu: \"river\". There is not any satisfactory theory on their origin. Some scholars connect Danaans with the Denyen, one of the groups of the sea peoples who attacked Egypt during the reign of Ramesses III (1187-1156 BCE). The same inscription mentions the Weshesh who might have been the Achaeans. The Denyen seem to have been inhabitants of the city Adana in Cilicia.

Schwarzenegger talked about Barbara in his memoir in 1977: \"Basically it came down to this: she was a well-balanced woman who wanted an ordinary, solid life, and I was not a well-balanced man, and hated the very idea of ordinary life.\" Baker has described Schwarzenegger as \"[a] joyful personality, totally charismatic, adventurous, and athletic\" but claims towards the end of the relationship he became \"insufferable \u2013 classically conceited \u2013 the world revolved around him\". Baker published her memoir in 2006, entitled Arnold and Me: In the Shadow of the Austrian Oak. Although Baker, at times, painted an unflattering portrait of her former lover, Schwarzenegger actually contributed to the tell-all book with a foreword, and also met with Baker for three hours. Baker claims, for example, that she only learned of his being unfaithful after they split, and talks of a turbulent", "An adolescent's environment plays a huge role in their identity development. While most adolescent studies are conducted on white, middle class children, studies show that the more privileged upbringing people have, the more successfully they develop their identity. The forming of an adolescent's identity is a crucial time in their life. It has been recently found that demographic patterns suggest that the transition to adulthood is now occurring over a longer span of years than was the case during the middle of the 20th century. Accordingly, youth, a period that spans late adolescence and early adulthood, has become a more prominent stage of the life course. This therefore has caused various factors to become important during this development. So many factors contribute to the developing social identity of an adolescent from commitment, to coping devices, to social media. All of these factors are affected by the environment an adolescent grows up in. A child from a more privileged upbringing is exposed to more opportunities and better situations in general.", "The landscapes of Thuringia are quite diverse. The far north is occupied by the Harz mountains, followed by the Goldene Aue, a fertile floodplain around Nordhausen with the Helme as most important river. The north-west includes the Eichsfeld, a hilly and sometimes forested region, where the Leine river emanates.

As an adolescent's social sphere develops rapidly as they distinguish the differences between friends and acquaintances, they often become heavily emotionally invested in friends. This is not harmful; however, if these friends expose an individual to potentially harmful situations, this is an aspect of peer pressure. Adolescence is a critical period in social development because adolescents can be easily influenced by the people they develop close relationships with. This is the first time individuals can truly make their own decisions, which also makes this a sensitive period. Relationships are vital in the social development of an adolescent due to the extreme influence peers can have over an individual. These relationships become significant because they begin to help the adolescent understand the concept", "In June 2013, West and television personality Kim Kardashian announced the birth of their first child, North.

One example is Tim Brennan of the Irish-American punk rock band Dropkick Murphys. In addition to electric guitar, bass, and drums, the band uses several instruments associated with traditional Celtic music, including mandolin, tin whistle, and Great Highland bagpipes. The band explains that these instruments accentuate the growling sound they favor. The 1991 R.E.M. hit \"Losing My Religion\" was driven by a few simple mandolin licks played by guitarist Peter Buck, who also played the mandolin in nearly a dozen other songs. The single peaked at No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart (#1 on the rock and alternative charts), Luther Dickinson of North Mississippi Allstars and The Black Crowes has made frequent use of the mandolin, most notably on", "Predators are often another organism's prey, and likewise prey are often predators. Though blue jays prey on insects, they may in turn be prey for cats and snakes, and snakes may be the prey of hawks. One way of classifying predators is by trophic level. Organisms that feed on autotrophs, the producers of the trophic pyramid, are known as herbivores or primary consumers; those that feed on heterotrophs such as animals are known as secondary consumers. Secondary consumers are a type of carnivore, but there are also tertiary consumers eating these carnivores, quartary consumers eating them, and so forth. Because only a fraction of energy is passed on to the next level, this hierarchy of predation must end somewhere, and very seldom goes higher than five or six levels, and may go only as high as three trophic levels (for example, a lion that preys upon large herbivores such as wildebeest, which", "In 680 Ibn al-Zubayr fled Medina for Mecca. Hearing about Husayn's opposition to Yazid I, the people of Kufa sent to Husayn asking him to take over with their support. Al-Husayn sent his cousin Muslim bin Agail to verify if they would rally behind him. When the news reached Yazid I, he sent Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad, ruler of Basrah, with the instruction to prevent the people of Kufa rallying behind Al-Husayn. Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad managed to disperse the crowd that gathered around Muslim bin Agail and captured him. Realizing Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad had been instructed to prevent Husayn from establishing support in Kufa, Muslim bin Agail requested a message to be sent to Husayn to prevent his immigration to Kufa. The request was denied and Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad", "On 1 September 1870, the battle opened with the Army of Ch\u00e2lons, with 202 infantry battalions, 80 cavalry squadrons and 564 guns, attacking the surrounding Prussian Third and Meuse Armies totaling 222 infantry battalions, 186 cavalry squadrons and 774 guns. General De Wimpffen, the commander of the French V Corps in reserve, hoped to launch a combined infantry and cavalry attack against the Prussian XI Corps. But by 11:00, Prussian artillery took a toll on the French while more Prussian troops arrived on the battlefield. The French cavalry, commanded by General Marguerite, launched three desperate attacks on the nearby village of Floing where the Prussian XI Corps was concentrated. Marguerite was killed leading the very first charge and the two additional charges led to nothing but heavy losses.

Typically, birds eliminate this waste mixed with feces as a semi-solid substance. Notably, while most birds follow this pattern, hummingbirds exhibit flexibility, functioning as facultative ammonotelic creatures, primarily expelling ammonia as their nitrogenous waste. These birds also produce creatine, differing from mammals which release creatinine. The excretory products and intestinal contents exit the body via the cloaca\u2014a versatile opening serving multiple functions such as waste expulsion, copulation, and egg laying in females. It's worth mentioning that certain species of birds engage in the act of regurgitating pellets. Within the group Palaeognathae, except for kiwis, male birds also participate in this behavior, alongside those in the Anseriformes class.", "The color of mammalian hair, or pelage, exhibits diversity across populations, individuals within populations, and even on the body of a single animal. A common phenomenon, this color variation often includes shades transitioning from light to dark. Age can sometimes dictate these changes, yet other instances involve influences unrelated to growth stages. Selective forces, including interactions with diverse ecosystems and environmental conditions, significantly impact mammalian coloring. These pressures, driving evolutionary adaptations for enhanced survival, frequently favor specific color attributes. While camouflage is traditionally seen as a primary driver of color evolution in mammals, evidence suggests that other factors\u2014such as sexual selection, communication mechanisms, and physiological processes\u2014also contribute. Among these, camouflage remains the leading mechanism for color variation, serving as an adaptation for both protection and social interaction.", "The significance of education in Israeli society, deeply rooted in cultural traditions stretching back to the ancient history of Israel, underscores its importance in the fabric of societal growth and development. Higher education is perceived as a cornerstone for social and economic advancement, serving as a key factor in enhancing mobility within Israeli society. This educational focus can be traced through the transformative period following the Renaissance and Enlightenment, continuing its trajectory until it became integral to the ideological foundation of Zionism around the late 19th century. Jewish communities in the Levant pioneered the concept of compulsory education, emphasizing collective responsibility over parental duty in nurturing the future generations' intellectual capabilities. \n\nContemporary Jewish culture places a strong emphasis on the value of scholarship, scholarly pursuits, and the cultivation of intellectual interests. This is reflected in the significant university attendance rates of Israeli citizens, demonstrating the society's high regard for higher education. The Israeli educational system has gained international recognition for its excellence and innovative teaching methods, contributing to its esteemed reputation globally.", "The Daily Northwestern, founded in 1881, is the principal student-run newspaper, published on weekdays during the academic year with no affiliations or funding from Northwestern University; it operates independently, supported solely by advertisements. Managed exclusively by undergraduates, it caters to the Northwestern community. North by Northwestern, initiated in September 2006 by Medill School of Journalism students, is an online magazine that updates readers on news and special events throughout weekdays and weekends, complemented by a quarterly print edition. Syllabus, the undergraduate yearbook, commenced publication in 1885 and encapsulates the annual happenings at Northwestern.

Some may have lost their status and sought refuge in areas south of the Yangtze River. Among those Chinese refugees from northern China, some may have settled around the vicinity of Hangzhou. As an illustration, the lineage of Zhuge Liang (181-234), a prominent chancellor of the state of Shu Han during the Three Kingdoms period in the central plains of northern China, congregated in the outskirts of Hangzhou, establishing the exclusive village Zhuge Village (Zhege Cun). Characterized by villagers sharing the surname \"Zhuge,\" this community purposefully insulated itself from neighboring towns for centuries, remaining relatively unknown until recent times. This scenario indicates that a few powerful and influential Chinese refugee families from the central plains may have relocated there.", "The start of the '98 season was marred by the passing of iconic broadcaster Harry Caray. Following the retirements of Sandberg and the trading away of Dunston, the Cubs faced the challenge of filling critical gaps in their roster. To bolster Sammy Sosa's lineup protection, they signed Henry Rodr\u00edguez, famously referred to as \"H-Rod,\" who contributed powerfully by hitting 31 home runs in his first season with the team. Kevin Tapani emerged as a standout performer for the Cubs with a career-high 19 victories, while Rod Beck dominated the bullpen, and Mark Grace delivered an outstanding campaign. In 1998, the Cubs were at the forefront of media focus, with superstar Sosa and rookie pitcher Kerry Wood being the headline stars. Wood's most notable achievement was tossing a one-hitter against the Houston Astros, where he equaled the major league record with 20 strikeouts in nine innings, earning the moniker \"Kid K.\" This remarkable display of pitching prowess secured him the 1998 NL Rookie of the Year award. Sosa ignited during the month of June, smashing an extraordinary 20 home runs.", "In today's world, adolescents confront unique challenges as their sexuality evolves. Although certain risks, like emotional turmoil and the likelihood of contracting sexually transmitted infections or diseases (including HIV/AIDS), are not inherently adolescent-specific, others\u2014such as unintended pregnancies resulting from contraceptive misuse\u2014are commonly viewed as societal concerns in Western societies. About one-quarter of sexually active teens will acquire an STI. In the U.S., many adolescents incorrectly think that abstaining from intercourse minimizes their risk of STIs, leading them to opt for other forms of sexual activity. Nationally, healthcare professionals have observed a rise in herpes and human papillomavirus (HPV) cases, which can lead to genital warts. Currently, it's estimated that HPV impacts roughly 15% of the population.", "Historically, the diverse South Slavic regions and their respective languages\u2014Chakavian, Kajkavian, and Shtokavian\u2014evolved independently, each reflecting the unique identities and cultural heritages of the areas involved. Prior to the 19th century, these languages were unified under monikers like \"Illyric,\" \"Slavic,\" \"Slavonian,\" \"Bosnian,\" \"Dalmatian,\" \"Serbian,\" or \"Croatian.\" This linguistic convergence led Jacob Grimm to coin the term \"Serbo-Croatian\" in 1824, which Jernej Kopitar, a prominent Viennese philologist, further popularized over subsequent decades. By 1854 and 1859, Croatian grammarians officially embraced this terminology as well. \n\nDuring this era, territories inhabited by Serbs and Croats remained within the empires of the Ottomans and Austrians. Despite this, the language was formally referred to with varying names, including \"Serbo-Croat,\" \"Croato-Serbian,\" \"Serbian and Croatian,\" \"Croatian and Serbian,\" \"Serbian or Croatian,\" and \"Croatian or Serbian.\" Informally, Serbs tended to refer to the language as \"Serbian,\" while Croats simply called it \"Croatian,\" without implying any division between the two. In the autonomous region of Bosnia and Herzegovina, all three\u2014B", "Identity formation occurs during adolescence, a critical phase in personal development. As adolescents embark on this journey, they experiment with various roles and personas as they seek to define themselves. This experimentation involves trying on different behaviors and identities as they explore their true self. The goal is to identify which personality traits or roles resonate most authentically with their core being. However, navigating this period is complicated by multifaceted influences such as familial dynamics, societal expectations, and social standing. While some studies might argue for the term \"development\" over \"formation\" due to the continuous nature of this process, it's clear that there is a systematic evolution in the content and form of their identity.", "Similar to Egypt, the immense Seleucid Empire was largely governed by a ruling class comprised of Greek and Macedonian elites. This Greek urban populace, forming the ascendant leadership, was bolstered by immigration from Greece. This demographic included new colonies such as Antioch, the Syrian tetrapolis cities, Seleucia positioned north of Babylon, and Dura-Europos alongside the Euphrates River. These settlements preserved classical Greek structures typical of city-states\u2014like assemblies, councils, and elected officials. However, this veneer concealed reality; the cities were invariably managed by the Seleucid monarchy's officials. Beyond these main cities, the Seleucids established numerous garrisons, military colonies, and Greek villages across their domain to strengthen their authority. This 'Greco-Macedonian' community coexisted within the empire, furthering the Seleucid's hegemony.", "The broad adoption of the identity perspective across various research fields leads to multifaceted implications. In occupational contexts, this shift poses particular challenges, especially within professions that may be viewed negatively or considered \"dirty work\" (Hughes, 1951). Tracy and Trethewey (2005) highlight that an individual's job choice is often influenced by the degree to which it aligns with their 'preferred organizational self'. Different occupations are associated with varying degrees of stigma or prestige. As Tracy exemplifies through the case of correctional officers (Tracy & Tretheway, 2005), the task of redefining one's identity within such roles involves overcoming preconceived notions, like being likened to 'glorified maids'.\n\nThis process of justification and valuation is integral to occupational satisfaction and overall well-being (Tracy & Scott, 2006, p. 33). It shapes not only how individuals perceive their roles but also their contribution to society and personal fulfillment. For those in these specialized and potentially stigmatized fields, navigating identity construction is crucial for maintaining motivation, fulfilling job responsibilities, and achieving a sense of purpose.", "Emotions profoundly influence social interactions and relationships, thus intertwining closely with fundamental physiological processes, especially those associated with stress regulation. The significance of this connection is underscored by the role emotions play in the anti-stress complex, involving the oxytocin-attachment system, which is crucial for fostering connections between individuals. Different emotional phenotypes or temperaments shape social integration and well-being within intricate social frameworks (Kurt Kortschal, 2013). Notably, these behavioral patterns are shared across various species and taxa, reflecting the cumulative impact of genetic inheritance. DNA sequences encode instructions for building cellular proteins, providing the foundational blueprint for organismal development. At the heart of each new life is a genetic code supplied by its parent's reproductive cells, and with each evolutionary branching point, heritable traits emerge, enabling the offspring to adapt and thrive in its environment.", "Stanley Schachter's theory builds upon the groundwork laid by Gregorio Mara\u00f1\u00f3n, a Spanish physician. Mara\u00f1\u00f3n experimented by injecting patients with epinephrine, then asking them about their feelings; he observed that without an emotion-inducing stimulus, patients struggled to connect their physical responses with any identifiable emotion. Schachter concurred that bodily reactions are crucial in emotional experiences. He posited that these reactions assist in directing our attention to a physically stimulating event, enabling us to appraise it specifically, which defines our emotional subjective experience. Essentially, emotions emerge through a dual-process: initial physiological arousal followed by the perception of that emotion. A vivid illustration is the scenario where the sight of a bear in the kitchen triggers heart palpitations - the physiological arousal is the precursor to the emotional experience of fear.", "The political situation persisted in its tumultuous state. Seeking strategic advantage, John initiated discussions with the recently returned French King Philip II, envisioning a pact that would grant him control over territories such as Normandy, Anjou, and others held by Richard. However, these aspirations were discouraged by John's mother. After Longchamp, ousted due to Walter's intervention, reappeared, he contended for his justiciar role, unjustly stripped from him, which John addressed by quelling his claims in exchange for assurances of administrative backing, including reinforcement of his claim to the throne's succession. Upon Richard's prolonged absence from the crusade, John started to assert that Richard was either deceased or permanently lost. It was revealed that Richard was actually captured on his way back to England by the Duke of Austria and subsequently held for ransom by Emperor Henry VI. Sensing an opportune moment, John capitalized on the situation and proceeded accordingly.", "In the early modern era, universities built upon the scholastic foundations of the Middle Ages, encompassing subjects like natural philosophy, logic, medicine, theology, mathematics, astronomy (including astrology), law, grammar, and rhetoric. The curriculum was heavily influenced by Aristotle's teachings, with medicine also greatly relying on the works of Galen and contributions from Arabic scholars. The pivotal shift that occurred is largely attributed to the impact of humanism. The introduction of humanist educators into the academic setting led to profound transformations, particularly in the realms of grammar and rhetoric, which were restructured around the principles of \"studia humanitatis.\" These educators prioritized cultivating students' abilities to articulate ideas eloquently, competently translate and interpret ancient texts, and aspire to live virtuous lives. This humanist emphasis had a ripple effect on other disciplines within the university. Scholars and educators were influenced not only by the humanist approach to learning but also by the linguistic mastery required to engage with classical texts. Medical professionals such as Niccol\u00f2 Leoniceno, Thomas Linacre, and William Cop exemplify the integration of humanist philosophy and methodologies into their work, being both trained and teaching from a humanist viewpoint.", "Throughout the period, candidates aligned with the Democratic Party consistently secured victories in local elections, thereby deepening the city's connections to the Southern region and its predominant political party. In 1861, amid the secession of the South, Mayor Fernando Wood proposed declaring independence from both the state capital, Albany, and the United States; however, this initiative did not receive any further action. The imposition of conscription laws during the American Civil War (1861-1865) fueled significant discontent, particularly among wealthier individuals who could evade service by paying a $300 fee ($5,766 equivalent in 2016) to secure a substitute. This dissatisfaction culminated in the Draft Riots of 1863, where the most visible participants were primarily the Irish working class.\n\nThe chaotic situation escalated into targeted assaults on the city's elite, which later evolved into widespread attacks on African-American residents and their properties following intense competition between Irish immigrants and black populations over employment opportunities for a decade. Notably, rioters set fire to the Colored Orphan Asylum, yet over 200 children managed to escape unharmed due to the swift actions of", "In the mid-18th century, particularly within the French Enlightenment era, the term underwent an ideological transformation. In 1765, an anonymous contributor to a French Enlightenment journal proposed, \"the universal affection for mankind... a quality long unrecognized in our society, which we shall dare to label 'humanism'; for the moment has arrived to conceptualize a term for such an admirable and essential concept.\" The late 18th century and the beginning of the 19th witnessed the establishment of numerous grassroots philanthropic and charitable organizations aimed at improving human welfare and disseminating knowledge (some were Christian in nature, others weren't). Following the French Revolution, it was believed that human virtues could be cultivated through rational thought, independent of conventional religious frameworks\u2014a notion that opponents associated with Enlightenment thinkers like Rousseau, leading to intense backlash.", "The outcome was a series of inventive yet unpopulated fiscal strategies. During his seventeen-year kingship, John imposed scutage duties eleven times, compared to a total of eleven times under the previous three rulers combined. Often, these were collected without any impending military campaigns, contradicting the premise that scutage served as a substitute for actual military duty. John capitalized on his authority to request relief payments upon inheritance of estates and castles, sometimes demanding astronomical sums that exceeded barons' capacities to pay. Building on the profitable sheriff appointments sold in 1194, John launched another round, with new incumbents recouping their investments through heightened fines and penalties, especially within forest territories. Expanding upon Richard's policy, John escalated fees for widows seeking to remain unmarried. Continuing his practice, John continued to auction charters for new towns, including", "During the Enlightenment, innovative concepts regarding religion emerged, notably Deism and discussions around atheism. Deism, as conceptualized by Thomas Paine, represents the straightforward belief in God as the Creator, devoid of reliance on the Bible or other supernatural sources. Instead, Deists adhere solely to personal reason as the guiding principle for their beliefs, an idea that resonated well with many thinkers of the era. While atheism was debated extensively, it was not widely embraced. Wilson and Reill observe that among the enlightened intellectuals, even those who openly criticized Christianity, few were actual atheists. They tended to lean towards skepticism, deism, vitalism, or pantheism, being critical of orthodox beliefs instead. Some argued, akin to Pierre Bayle, that atheists could indeed lead ethical lives. Others, such as Voltaire, contended that without belief in a deity that punishes evil, the societal moral structure would crumble. In essence, these figures either questioned the need for a Supreme Authority or doubted the enforcement of laws and the deterrence of immoral actions through the fear of divine retribution.", "Sleep primarily influences memory consolidation, enhancing brain functions related to memory stability and retention without impacting learning or recall when awake. Neural connections within the brain strengthen during sleep stages, specifically slow-wave sleep (SWS), which is crucial for memory enhancement. Multiple studies confirm that sleep boosts memory retention by actively consolidating memories. The process of system consolidation occurs during SWS, involving the reactivation of memories with selective enhancement and qualitative changes. While the hippocampus replays daily events for the neocortex during sleep, the latter processes and transfers these memories to long-term storage. Insufficient sleep weakens neural connections, making learning more challenging due to less potent consolidation, thus potentially diminishing learning efficiency.", "Contrary to popular belief, memory functions do not operate like a simple recorder; rather, it's a complex process characterized by dynamic molecular mechanisms that unfold across varying temporal stages, ranging from mere seconds to an entire lifetime. What's fascinating is that our recollections aren't static or absolute; instead, they are constructed during both the initial encoding and recall phases. A notable demonstration of this phenomenon was provided by a study led by Elizabeth Loftus and John Palmer (1974), where participants were shown a film of a car crash and subsequently queried about their observations. The experiment revealed that individuals who were queried using the phrasing \"How fast were the cars going when they smashed into each other?\" tended to provide higher speed estimations compared to those using the wording \"How fast were the cars going when they hit each other?\" Moreover, one week post-experiment, those participants initially asked the former question showed nearly double the likelihood of recalling witnessing broken glass in the film, underscoring how subtle variations in questioning can significantly influence memory reconstruction.", "During the 2nd millennium BC, the contemporary region of Zhejiang was not significantly influenced by the Shang civilization's sphere of power. Rather, this territory was inhabited by diverse groups collectively referred to as the 'Hundred Yue,' comprising elements like the Dongyue and the Ouyue. Documentation dating back to the Spring and Autumn Period initially mentions the kingdom of Yue. Historically, Yue was situated in the northern part of Zhejiang, as per these records. The Shiji indicates that Yue's rulers claimed lineage from Yu the Great, the founder of the Shang dynasty. Archaeological findings suggest that the Baiyue people and the kingdom of Yue had unique cultural and historical identities that diverged from those of the kingdoms in the northern and central regions of China. These regions' cultures and histories were meticulously documented in chronicles and histories during the Spring and Autumn period and the Qin dynasty. A notable work is the Song of the Yue Boatman (Chinese: \u8d8a\u4eba\u6b4c, p Yu\u00e8r\u00e9n G\u0113, meaning \"Song of the Yue Fisher\") which highlights Yue's distinct cultural heritage.", "The Protestant movement expanded beyond Germany into France, earning its followers the moniker Huguenots. Calvin remained engaged with French religious developments from his Geneva base, educating clergy who guided church communities. Despite intense persecution, the Reformed faith grew significantly across France, resonating with individuals disillusioned by the Catholic Church's inflexibility and contentment. French Protestantism developed a strong political dimension, particularly evident through noble conversions in the 1550s. This laid the groundwork for a series of conflicts, known collectively as the French Wars of Religion. The intensity of these wars escalated following King Henry II's abrupt death in 1559. Barbarity and violence characterized the era, reaching its zenith during the notorious St. Bartholomew's Day massacre in August 1572, when Catholic forces killed between 30,000 and 100,000 Huguenots across the country. These conflicts marked a period of extreme carnage.", "The NFL's preseason schedule exhibits a notable level of organization compared to other team sports. Each team competes in precisely four non-competitive matches annually, two hosted at home and two away, with the exception being made for two clubs per year, which participate in an extra game known as the Pro Football Hall of Fame Game. Primarily held in August, these exhibitions serve as a tool for coaches to whittle down their player rosters from 90 during the off-season to the standard 53 for the regular season. Although the NFL's preseason match scheduling isn't as stringent as its regular season counterpart, it still adheres to a myriad of constraints and traditions that limit the selection of opponents. Teams also face limitations regarding when and on which days they can conduct these games.\n\nA practice commonly observed in baseball and hockey, split-squad games, involves scheduling teams to play two matches on the same day. In such cases, the team would divide itself into two separate squads to compete concurrently.", "In the early and mid-1980s, Libya encountered significant economic difficulties, with its annual oil revenue declining from $21 billion in 1982 to $5.4 billion by 1986. This period marked the beginning of substantial investment in irrigation infrastructure, most notably the \"Gaddafi's Pet Project,\" the Great Man-Made River, which was initiated in 1983. However, the project, intended to be completed by the end of the decade, remained unfinished as the new millennium dawned. During this time, military expenditures surged while funding for other administrative sectors was reduced.\n\nLibya had historically supported the FROLINAT militia in neighboring Chad. In December 1980, in response to a request from the FROLINAT-controlled GUNT government amid a civil war, Libya once again invaded Chad. Gaddafi proposed a political union in January 1981. The Organization of African Unity (OAU), however, rejected this suggestion and called for Libya's withdrawal, which occurred in November 1981. Following this, the civil war persisted, prompting Libya to reintroduce its troops into Chad, leading to clashes with French forces who were supporting the southern Chadian forces.", "South Korea - Seoul, the city that had previously welcomed the 1988 Summer Olympics, was the venue for an event on April 27th, which faced protests from intended participants, Choi Seung-kook and Park Won-sun. These individuals refrained from attending due to their opposition towards China's actions in Tibet. The city, known for its modern sports infrastructure constructed for the 1988 games, saw the deployment of over 8,000 riot police to secure the 24-kilometer route that started at the Olympic Park. \n\nOn the day of the torch relay in Seoul, tensions escalated as Chinese students engaged in confrontations with the protestors, engaging in acts of violence such as hurling stones, bottles, and fists. In a dramatic incident, a North Korean defector, whose brother had also defected to China only to be subsequently detained and executed by the DPRK, attempted to self-immolate as a protest against China's treatment of North Korean refugees. Although he poured gasoline on himself, the police swiftly intervened, surrounding and carrying him away before significant harm could occur. Additionally, two other demonstrators attempted to disrupt the relay but were unsuccessful.\n\nAs the event progressed, there emerged a confrontation at the start involving approximately 500 Chinese supporters opposing the protesters, indicative of the strong emotions and differing viewpoints surrounding the relay.", "The interpretations of separation of powers by Jefferson and Madison have sparked debate over time. During his presidency, Jefferson declined to issue Congress's Thanksgiving Proclamations, but as the Governor of Virginia, he did issue a Thanksgiving and Prayer proclamation. In contrast, Madison, as President, issued four religious proclamations but vetoed two bills due to their infringement on the First Amendment. Despite this, both men attended religious services at the Capitol. Prior to the Constitution's ratification, Madison argued that \"Religion cannot be subjected to the authority of the society at large, even less to that of the legislative body.\" Following his presidential tenure, Madison expressed the idea of a complete separation between church and state. He maintained that \"strong measures\" safeguard the division between religion and government, as outlined in the Constitution, and emphasized the need for \"a practical distinction between religion and civil governance.\"", "Upon their release, Virgil's works dramatically transformed Latin literature, leading them to become foundational texts in the education of educated Romans. They were widely recognized within the curriculum, and numerous poets would later allude to his works to construct new meanings within their own compositions. For instance, the Augustan poet Ovid playfully referenced the initial lines of the Aeneid in Amores 1.1.1-2, and his compact retelling of the Aeneas narrative in the Metamorphoses' Book 14, famously termed the \"mini-Aeneid,\" exemplifies a critical response to Virgilian epic conventions. \n\nLucan's epic poem, the Bellum Civile, was interpreted as a counterpoint to Virgil's style. By eliminating the supernatural elements, focusing on historical occurrences, and markedly deviating from the methods of Virgilian epics, Lucan created a unique work. Meanwhile, the Flavian poet Statius, in his 12-part epic Thebaid, closely interacted with Virgil's poetry, urging his creation not to compete with the divine Aeneid but rather to respectfully follow its trail.\n\nIn Silius Italicus, a notable contemporary, Virgil continued to be a crucial influence and source of inspiration, despite the passage of time.", "Terry Eastland, the writer of \"From Ending Affirmative Action: The Case for Colorblind Justice,\" argues that most justifications for affirmative action are categorized into two main types: rectifying historical discrimination and fostering diversity. Eastland asserts that the originators of affirmative action did not foresee its impact on benefiting individuals who did not require it, specifically middle-class minorities. Furthermore, she posits that the affirmative action policy often engenders a sense of shame and entitlement among minorities due to its inherent stigma. According to Eastland, affirmative action carries significant risks that sometimes result in limited benefits, suggesting that society could operate more freely without such measures.\n\nThomas Sowell, a libertarian economist, identified what he perceives as detrimental effects of affirmative action in his book \"Affirmative Action Around the World: An Empirical Study.\" Sowell's argument suggests that affirmative action policies motivate underrepresented groups to claim membership in favored groups, thereby potentially distorting meritocracy and exacerbating social divisions.", "The most extensive military engagement for the United States in this period was the War of 1812. Amidst Britain's conflict with Napoleon's France, it aimed to hinder America's trade with France. Seeking neutrality while pursuing international commerce, the U.S. opposed Britain's trade restrictions and the forced enlistment of sailors from American vessels into the Royal Navy, despite vigorous protest. Britain also aided an Indian uprising in the Midwest, with the objective of establishing an Indian nation to obstruct American territorial expansion. Consequently, the U.S. declared war on Britain in 1812, marking the first official war declaration by the U.S. with the intent of neutralizing the Royal Navy, they instead invaded British Canada, hoping to leverage captured territories as leverage. The Canadian invasion proved unsuccessful, yet conflicts with Native Americans on the west frontier (Tecumseh's War and the Creek War) were marginally more successful. Following Britain's defeat of Napoleon in 1814, sizable veteran forces were dispatched to invade America.", "Regarding the peripheral territories, the Qing Dynasty exercised imperial supervision, with the emperor assuming the roles of the Mongol Khan, patron of Tibetan Buddhism, and guardian of Muslims. Nonetheless, the Qing's approach shifted upon the establishment of Xinjiang Province in 1884. Amidst the Great Game period, exploiting the Dungan revolt in northwest China, Yaqub Beg invaded Xinjiang from Central Asia, receiving support from the British Empire. This led to the establishment of his rule over the kingdom of Kashgaria. The Qing court dispatched troops to counter Yaqub Beg, subsequently reasserting control over Xinjiang, thereby integrating the political framework of Mainland China into the region. The Kumul Khanate, having been assimilated into the Qing Empire as a vassal following assistance in defeating the Zunghars in 1757, retained its status post-Xinjiang's provincial transformation until the conclusion of the Qing dynasty during the Xinhai Revolution up to 1930. In the early 20th century, Britain deployed an expeditionary force to Tibet, compelling Tibetans to", "BYU fields 21 NCAA-sponsored teams, with 19 of those participating predominantly in the Mountain West Conference from its start in 1999 until the institution departed in 2011. Previously, its teams had competed in the Western Athletic Conference. Despite their varied names, all teams are collectively known as the \"Cougars,\" with Cosmo the Cougar serving as the mascot since 1953. \"The Cougar Fight Song\" serves as the school's fight song. Notably, due to the requirement for most student-athletes to engage in a two-year full-time religious mission (for males at age 18 and females at 19), BYU athletes typically have a higher average age compared to peers at other institutions. The NCAA permits this missionary service without reducing athletes' eligibility periods. This practice has sparked some debate, but it's generally acknowledged not to confer a substantial advantage, considering the absence of regular training during their missions. BYU's refusal to schedule games on Sundays, a day sacred to its predominantly Latter-day Saint student body, has also drawn attention from sports networks.", "John regarded the interdict as tantamount to a papal declaration of war. His response involved endeavoring to hold Innocent personally accountable while seeking to alienate English clergy, creating divisions between those inclined towards supporting him and those firmly aligned with Rome. He confiscated the lands of clergy reluctant to conduct services, and targeted estates associated with Innocent. He arrested illicit concubines among clergymen, releasing them only upon payment of fines, and seized the estates of church members who had left England. John also vowed protection for any clergy willing to remain devoted to him. Notably, various institutions often negotiated terms for managing their own properties and maintaining the income from their estates. By 1209, the impasse persisted, leading Innocent to warn of excommunication should John not accept Langton's appointment. Upon this warning being ineffective, Innocent pursued other strategies.", "In China's mainland, Japanese divisions including the 3rd, 6th, and 40th,\u96c6\u7ed3\u4e8e\u5cb3\u9633\u5e76\u5206\u4e09\u8def\u5357\u8fdb, crossing the Xinqiang River, then attempted to breach the Miluo River aiming for Changsha. The turning point came in January 1942 when Chinese troops achieved a significant victory in Changsha, marking the initial Allied triumph over Japan. Following the Doolittle Raid, the Japanese executed an extensive operation in Zhejiang and Jiangxi, referred to as the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Campaign. Their objectives were to locate and punish any remaining American pilots, along with damaging air bases. This mission, initiated in May 1942 with a contingent of 40 infantry battalions and 15-16 artillery units, was thwarted by the Chinese forces in September.

However, the review also pointed out some drawbacks, notably criticizing the console's design and disc-loading mechanism. It was noted that there were instances where the cover failed to engage properly, making it feel akin to an outdated device used for imprinting credit cards\u2014indicating an overall impression of cheapness. This critique highlighted the inconvenience of manual disc loading, underscoring the value of automatic disc trays once they were no longer available. \n\nThe review suggested that this decision could have been either a cost-cutting measure or a strategic move to conserve space, but either way, it represented a setback. Additionally, the pricing aspect was scrutinized, with the cheapest Super Slim model being priced higher than the cheapest Slim model. The commentary also questioned the notion that the smaller size and larger hard drive constituted an actual improvement, given that the Slim model's hard drive was easily removable and replaceable, negating any potential upgrade associated with these features.", "In July 1645, Dorgon issued a highly contentious decree known as the \"haircutting order,\" compelling adult Han Chinese males to adopt the queue hairstyle, typically worn by Manchu men, with the threat of execution for non-compliance. This directive succinctly encapsulated the stark choice facing those subjected to it: \"Keep your head, lose your hair; keep your hair, lose your head.\" From a Manchu perspective, this mandate served as a measure of loyalty and a method to differentiate allies from adversaries. Conversely, for the Han Chinese populace, the order was a profoundly degrading symbol of Qing dominance, challenging deeply rooted Confucian ideals. According to the Classic of Filial Piety (Xiaojing), respecting one's body and hair is a sacred duty, as they are precious gifts bestowed by one's parents, deserving of protection rather than alteration. During the Ming Dynasty, adult males refrained from cutting their hair, opting instead to adorn their appearances with alternative modes of grooming.", "The concept of boundaries exhibits dual nature, being either inclusive or exclusive, contingent upon societal perception. An exclusive boundary emerges when someone enforces limitations through identifiers, constraining others' behavior. Conversely, inclusivity is realized by utilizing markers readily and aptly embraced by others. Notably, inclusive boundaries indirectly place constraints on included individuals through restriction in their participation across other boundaries. For illustration, a newcomer's adoption of a specific language in a multilingual setting illustrates this dichotomy. The efficacy of language comprehension varies among attendees, leading some to interpret the newcomer's linguistic choice as merely a neutral aspect of identity. Alternatively, this selection might evoke the impression of an exclusive boundary, intended to delineate the newcomer from them. This illustrates the complex interplay between individual identity expression and the resultant perception of inclusivity or exclusivity.", "During the 78 rpm era, several manufacturers introduced innovative, flexible records often advertised as \"unbreakable,\" utilizing unconventional materials. In the UK, Nicole records emerged around 1904, characterized by celluloid or equivalent material layered on a cardboard center, albeit with notably high levels of surface noise. \n\nIn contrast, the American market witnessed the introduction of flexible, fiber-centered \"Marconi Velvet Tone\" records by Columbia Records in 1907, which boasted significantly quieter surfaces; however, their commercial success was contingent upon the meticulous use of exclusive, gold-plated Marconi needles. \n\nBy the early 1930s, attempts like the German Phonycord, alongside British records such as the Filmophone and Goodson series, showcased early forays into thin, plastic record production. However, these efforts, though promising, failed to endure the test of time.\n\nContemporary to these innovations were the French Path\u00e9 Cellodiscs, featuring a very thin, black plastic composition that strikingly resembled their predecessors while offering improved durability. Despite these advancements, the Cellodiscs, like other early plastic records, did not achieve lasting popularity or impact within the industry.", "Following the signing of the Treaty of Versailles in 1919, Alsace-Lorraine was reclaimed by France, in line with President Woodrow Wilson's \"Fourteen Points\", without requiring a public vote. This transfer of territory was retrospectively marked on Armistice Day. It is uncertain if a local referendum in Strasbourg would have resulted in a favorable outcome for France given that the pro-autonomy Alsace parties, which sought either autonomy within Germany or a link to France, garnered only a minor share of votes in the last Reichstag elections and in local polls. \n\nAfter the region was annexed by Germany in 1871, there was a notable shift in voter sentiment towards pro-French autonomists, particularly prevalent in the more rural areas and other towns. The initiative began with the first Reichstag election, where these candidates were termed \"les d\u00e9put\u00e9s protestataires\". Until Bismarck's downfall in 1890, these individuals were the sole representatives of Alsatians serving in the German parliament.", "While Western Europe was establishing new kingdoms, the Eastern Roman Empire endured, experiencing an economic resurgence that stretched until the early 7th century. The eastern sections faced fewer invasions, with the majority concentrated in the Balkans. The empire enjoyed a prolonged period of peace with Persia, its traditional adversary, for much of the 5th century. The East was characterized by a closer alignment between the state and the Christian Church, with theological concerns playing a significant role in its political landscape, unlike in Western Europe.\n\nIn terms of legal advancements, there was the first attempt at codifying Roman law, known as the Theodosian Code, completed in 438. Under Emperor Justinian (reigning from 527 to 565), a more comprehensive code, the Corpus Juris Civilis, was compiled. Additionally, Justinian initiated the construction of the Hagia Sophia in Constantinople, successfully reclaimed North Africa from the Vandals, and Italy from the Ostrogoths, thanks to Belisarius, who passed away in 565. However, the conquest of Italy was not fully realized due to a devastating plague outbreak in 542. This incident resulted in Justinian's later reign focusing primarily on defense strategies.", "Upon the release of the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) in the United States, the console's design intentionally diverged from rival gaming hardware. Seeking to set its product apart from the negative image associated with video game systems following the industry downturn in 1983, Nintendo implemented a distinctive front-loading zero insertion force (ZIF) cartridge slot. This design, reminiscent of a VCR's loading mechanism, was intended to differentiate the NES's appearance. While it functioned effectively under optimal conditions, featuring clean connections and fresh connector pins, the ZIF system wasn't technically zero insertion force. Users encountered an issue where applying pressure to insert the cartridge into the slot would bend the connection pins and push the ROM board into the cartridge. Over time, frequent insertion and removal of cartridges led to degradation of the pins due to repeated use, ultimately affecting the system's performance and reliability.", "The Protestant movement played a pioneering role in advocating for religious liberty, with concerns for freedom of belief being a central aspect on both theological and societal fronts following Martin Luther's refusal to recant his convictions at the Imperial Diet of Worms in 1521. Luther viewed faith as an act of divine inspiration, inherently personal and thus not subject to coercion. Groups such as the Anabaptists and Huguenots, who were subjected to persecution, emphasized the importance of freedom of conscience and advocated for separation between church and state. By the early 17th century, figures like John Smyth and Thomas Helwys, through their writings supporting religious freedom, laid groundwork that significantly impacted thinkers like John Milton and John Locke's notions on toleration. It was under the guidance of individuals such as Roger Williams, a Baptist leader; Thomas Hooker, a Congregationalist; and William Penn, a Quaker, that colonies like Rhode Island, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania were established. These territories incorporated democratic governance structures alongside protections for religious freedom, serving as sanctuary spaces for oppressed religious communities, including Jews. The foundational documents of the United States, namely the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights, further entrenched these principles of religious liberty within the nation's legal framework.", "Birds possess an exceptionally efficient mechanism for oxygen diffusion into their blood, boasting ten times the surface-to-volume ratio for gas exchange compared to mammals. Consequently, birds feature a higher density of blood in their capillaries relative to the lung volume of mammals. Their arterial walls are robustly composed of thick, elastic muscle tissue designed to endure the force exerted by ventricular contractions, becoming increasingly rigid as they recede from the heart. Oxygen and nutrients are transported through arteries that constrict, followed by arterioles, which act primarily as conduits to deliver these vital substances to all bodily tissues. As arterioles branch away from the heart and towards specific organs and tissues, they further divide to augment surface area and reduce blood flow rate. As the blood proceeds through arterioles, it enters the capillaries where oxygen exchange occurs. These capillaries are arranged in bed-like structures within tissues, thereby facilitating optimal oxygen transfer and metabolic waste removal.", "The men's basketball squad boasts more than 1,600 victories, ranking among the dozen institutions with this accolade, and has participated in 28 NCAA tournaments. Notably, former team member Austin Carr stands as the holder of the record for most points in a single tournament game, tallying an impressive 61 points. Despite not securing the NCAA championship title, the team has been honored twice as national champions by the Helms Athletic Foundation. They've achieved several upsets against top-ranked opponents; notably, in 1974, they brought an end to UCLA's historic 88-game winning streak. This achievement, alongside eight further victories over number-one teams, places them second historically in total wins against the highest-ranked teams, trailing UCLA's record by one victory. The team competes in the refurbished Purcell Pavilion, situated within the Edmund P. Joyce Center, which reopened for the start of the 2009\u20132010 season. Currently, the team is led by Coach Mike Brey, whose tenure as head coach extends through the 2014\u201315 season.", "Pierre Belon's observation in 1553, about 100 years post the fall of Constantinople in 1453, highlighted the utilization of pissasphalto, a concoction of pitch and bitumen, in Dubrovnik for ship tar coating. This product was then exported to a Venetian marketplace, accessible to all buyers. An 1838 issue of Mechanics Magazine referenced an asphalt application in France at an early stage. In a 1621 pamphlet authored by \"certain Monsieur d'Eyrinys\", it was disclosed that he had stumbled upon significant asphalt deposits near Neufchatel. His vision included leveraging this resource for diverse purposes, notably in the creation of airtight grain storage facilities and in safeguarding Paris's waterways from pollution through the application of arches.", "Established in 1852, Marshall Field & Company emerged as the leading department store on Chicago's State Street, a prominent retail hub in the Midwest region. High-end customers would travel by rail from across the area, frequenting nearby accommodations to indulge at Field's. The business expanded into a significant chain prior to its rebranding to Macy's on September 9, 2006. Marshall Field's pioneered the industry with its exemplary customer service standards, setting a benchmark for other department stores to emulate. Additionally, the brand is synonymous with the iconic Frango mints, originally part of the Frederick & Nelson Department Store chain, which became emblematic of both Marshall Field's and Chicago itself following their merger. \n\nMarshall Field's was trailblazing in its innovation, being the first department store to establish a European buying office in Manchester, England, and the first to introduce a bridal registry concept. It was pioneering in introducing the idea of the personal shopper, a service offered without cost to customers in every Field's location, even up until the end under its original nameplate.", "Conduit third-rail current collection was employed by some street trams or streetcars, which utilized a rail positioned beneath the street level for power transmission. The system involved a plough, also known as a \"plow\" in the U.S., sliding into a narrow opening within the road to collect electricity. The city of Washington, D.C., which stopped its streetcar operations in 1962, notably maintained this system in many but not all of its former networks to sidestep the visual clutter caused by overhead wires and poles typical of electric transport. A similar approach was taken with Manhattan's streetcar network. The remnants of this method of operation are still evident on the track leading to the disused Kingsway Tramway Subway in central London, U.K., where the space between the running rails that accommodated the slot for the plough can be easily observed. Additionally, traces of this system can be found on P and Q Streets, situated west of Wisconsin Avenue, in the historic Georgetown district.", "Based on the 2010 Census data, Asian Americans in New York City amount to over one million individuals, surpassing the combined totals of San Francisco and Los Angeles. The Big Apple holds the distinction of having the highest Asian population among all cities within the United States, with Queens serving as its hub and boasting the largest Asian American population and the highest Andean (Colombian, Ecuadorian, Peruvian, and Bolivian) populations in the country. Moreover, it's acknowledged as the most ethnically diverse urban area globally.\n\nThe Chinese population notably grows at the quickest pace within New York State. This growth manifests through the flourishing of multiple Chinatown extensions across Brooklyn (\"\u7d10\u7d04\u83ef\u57e0\") and Flushing, Queens (\"\u6cd5\u62c9\u76db\u83ef\u57e0\"), which were once traditional urban enclaves. The expansion has also ventured eastward into suburban Nassau County on Long Island, as the broader New York metropolitan area and New York State emerge as top choices for new Chinese immigrants. According to figures from 2012, 6.3% of New York City's residents were of Chinese descent.", "In their 2003 paper \"Human Genetic Diversity and the Nonexistence of Biological Races,\" Jeffrey Long and Rick Kittles offer a comprehensive critique of how forensic statistics theory (FST) is utilized with human populations. They argue that the statistic showing 85% is deceptive due to its implication that each human group on average carries 85% of all genetic diversity, which inaccurately characterizes human population dynamics. Their contention is that this oversimplification fails to acknowledge the interconnected nature of human groups, treating them as isolated entities rather than part of a larger interconnected system.\n\nA more accurate perspective is provided by recognizing that certain human groups act as progenitors to others, thereby forming what Long and Kittles refer to as paraphyletic groups within the broader context of descent groups. This means that some populations are foundational to the development of others but are not themselves fully inclusive of their lineage, acting instead as representatives of ancestral roots rather than complete lineages. \n\nFor illustration, under the contemporary theory of a recent African origin, the human populace in Africa is portrayed as the ancestral group from which all non-African populations originate. However, the non-African populations are not a comprehensive representation; they are actually derived from a limited, non-representative subset of the African population.", "The transformation of Libya's economy involved a growing trend towards privatization, a shift from the socialist industrial policies espoused in The Green Book. Nevertheless, government officials contended that they were implementing \"people's socialism,\" a concept distinct from capitalist ideologies. Gaddafi embraced these reforms, advocating for extensive privatization in his March 2003 address. By 2003, the oil sector underwent substantial privatization, being acquired by private entities, and by 2004, it received $40 billion in direct foreign investments, marking a remarkable sixfold increase compared to the previous year. Resistance against these changes manifested through public protests among segments of the Libyan populace. In March 2006, radical revolutionaries assumed control of the General People's Committee (GPC) cabinet, although they reduced the pace of the reform efforts without halting them altogether. Plans surfaced in 2010 suggesting that up to half of Libya's economy could be privatized within a decade. Despite these economic reforms, political liberalization remained largely unaccompanied, with Gaddafi maintaining a strong grip on power. In March 2010, the government delegated more authority to municipal councils. The number of individuals demonstrating against these reforms continued to grow.", "Military operations initiated in September 1806, with Napoleon outlining the strategic approach in a significant letter to Marshal Soult, emphasizing key elements of Napoleonic tactics and introducing the concept of \"square battalion.\" This system entailed the Grande Arm\u00e9e's diverse corps marching in a cohesive formation at close proximity, ensuring immediate reinforcement if any single unit encountered an attack. With an army of 180,000, Napoleon aimed to conquer Prussia swiftly, particularly focusing on the right side of the River Saale. Seeking to defeat one enemy before additional forces could shift the conflict's balance, he moved decisively after discovering the location of the Prussian army, crossing the Saale with overwhelming power. The decisive twin engagements at Jena and Auerstedt, on October 14th, conclusively defeated the Prussians.", "The resolution of German diplomatic relations, particularly the dismissal of Maxim Litvinov, who was perceived negatively due to his Jewish heritage by Nazi Germany, is widely acknowledged by historians as a pivotal moment that facilitated discussions with Germany. Stalin promptly instructed Molotov to \"eliminate Jews from the ministry,\" highlighting the change in policy. Litvinov's previous efforts to establish an anti-fascist alliance, his endorsement of the collective security doctrine with France and Britain, and his relatively pro-Western stance compared to the Kremlin's views, underscored his role as a potential mediator between the Soviet Union and Western powers. His removal thus signaled the possibility of a rapprochement with Germany, which could have been a strategic move for Stalin to isolate the West. Molotov's subsequent appointment acted as a clear indicator to Germany that the Soviet Union was receptive to diplomatic overtures. This move not only hinted at an alternative negotiation avenue with Germany but also impacted relations with France and Britain, who likely interpreted it as a shift in Soviet foreign policy. A British official noted the loss of Litvinov as a valuable technical advisor and diplomat, contrasting Molotov's approach as more ideologically driven rather than traditionally diplomatic or internationalist. Carr posits that the Soviet Union's transition from Litvinov to Molotov represented a significant reevaluation of its geopolitical strategies, potentially leading to a recalibration of its relationships with both Germany and the Western Allies.", "Gaddafi was widely characterized by critics and Western media as an authoritarian ruler, known for his brutality, arrogance, vanity, and foolishness. Designated as the \"most wanted public enemy\" by the US during the Reagan era, he was famously termed the \"Mad Dog of the Middle East.\" Under his governance, the Libyan populace was alleged to have been under constant intimidation, owing to extensive surveillance activities by the regime, leading many to describe Libya as a \"state of pervasive police control.\" His detractors strongly criticized the human rights violations prevalent under his rule, with reports from Human Rights Watch (HRW) suggesting that hundreds of political prisoners often faced unfair trials and endured torture or unlawful executions. These practices were particularly highlighted at the Abu Salim prison, culminating in a reported massacre on June 29, 1996, where HRW estimated a significant number of fatalities.", "A genuine predator is typically identified as an organism that kills and consumes another living being. Unlike various other predatory species that cause harm to their prey in diverse ways, a predator directly results in the death of its target. Predators employ different strategies: some actively pursue prey, engaging in pursuit predation, while others prefer a more passive approach, patiently waiting for their prey to come within striking distance, exemplifying ambush predators. Predators display a range of tactics when dealing with their food, from dismembering and chewing large prey, like a jaguar or human, before consumption, to consuming smaller prey intact, as a bottlenose dolphin might swallow a fish, or a snake, duck, or stork could gulp down a frog. Domestic cats and dogs, serving as prime examples, exhibit a versatility in handling prey of both large and small sizes based on the situation; a domestic cat, for instance, might consume a large insect whole but dismantle a rabbit into smaller parts. In some instances, predation involves the use of venom to immobilize prey before ingestion, facilitating a lethal capture.", "The Israelites experienced\u4e24\u6b21independence as a nation in antiquity. Initially, this sovereignty spanned the era of the biblical judges and the United Monarchy. Following the decline of the United Monarchy, the region was partitioned into Israel and Judah. Significantly, the term 'Jew' emerged from the Latin \"Judean,\" signifying inhabitants of the southern kingdom of Judah. Although not explicitly stated in the Torah, this transition from 'Israelites' to 'Jews' (referring to those from Judah) is clarified in the Book of Esther, dating from around the 4th century BCE. This text, part of the Ketuvim, the third division of the Jewish Tanakh, underscores the shift in ethnonym. In 587 BCE, under King Nebuchadnezzar II of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, Jerusalem fell, the First Temple was destroyed, and leading figures from Judah were forcibly removed. By 586 BCE, Judah lost its status as an independent kingdom, leaving the remaining Jewish population Stateless. The Babylonian Exile came to an end in 539 BCE upon the conquest of Babylon by the Achaemenid Empire and the rule of Cyrus the Great.", "According to Van Praag, the Ming dynasty initiated diplomatic missions to Tibet primarily to acquire essential horses. Contrary to this perspective, Wang and Nyima contend that these were not diplomatic missions but rather administrative measures, where Tibetan territories were governed by the Ming Empire following the appointment of Tibetan leaders as officials within the Ming bureaucracy. They suggest that horse collections from Tibet served as a compulsory 'corv\u00e9e' tax, implying that Tibetans were engaged in internal administration, not external diplomacy.\n\nSperling's view is more complex, emphasizing the multifaceted nature of Ming-Tibetan interactions. He asserts that the Ming concurrently purchased horses from the Kham region, engaged in conflicts with Tibetan tribes in Amdo, and received Tibetan envoys in Nanjing. Moreover, he posits that Tibetan lamas' embassy visits to the Ming court were largely focused on facilitating commercial transactions between the lamas' sizable, affluent entourages and the Ming Chinese traders and officials.\n\nKolma\u0161 offers insights into the balance of power dynamics. He maintains that the Ming adopted a hands-off approach towards Tibet while imposing certain restrictions on the size of Tibetan entourages. Nevertheless, the Tibetans pursued a vassal-like relationship with the Ming due to the perceived benefits of imperial patronage, which seemingly compensated for the constraints placed upon them.", "On November 14, 1908, the Guangxu Emperor passed away, with Cixi succumbing to her demise the very next day, November 15, 1908. Speculations arose suggesting that either Cixi or Yuan Shikai orchestrated the death of the Guangxu Emperor through the administration of poisoned substances by loyal eunuchs, a theory substantiated by arsenic traces found at lethal levels in the Emperor's post-mortem examination nearly a century later. Puyi, who was designated as the successor at just two years old, being the eldest son of Zaifeng, Prince Chun, and nephew to the Guangxu Emperor who lacked offspring, left Zaifeng with the regency. Subsequently, Yuan Shikai was relieved of his leadership roles. In April 1911, Zaifeng established a cabinet consisting of two vice-premiers, yet it was famously referred to as \"The Royal Cabinet\" due to the composition of its thirteen members, five of whom held prominent governmental positions.", "Birds undergo systematic molt, with the adult plumage post-breeding phase referred to as the \"nonsoliciting\" or \"primary\" plumage, while breeding variations or modifications are termed \"alternate\" plumages according to the Humphrey-Parkes classification. Annual molting is typical, though some species may experience two molts yearly, and larger birds like raptors might molt less frequently, every few years. Molt patterns differ among species. In passerine birds, flight feathers are replaced sequentially, with the inner primaries leading, and the outermost tertiaries initiating shedding once the fifth or sixth primary has been replaced. Following the innermost tertiaries' molt, the secondaries start to fall out, progressing outward (centrifugal molt), and the greater primary covert feathers are molted concurrently with their overlapped primaries. Certain species exhibit a smaller subset of these characteristics, exemplified by", "The emergence of agrarian societies in Southeast Europe dates back to the 7th millennium BC, with evidence supported by one of Europe's oldest farming settlements found in Vasht\u00ebmi, southern Albania, estimated to be approximately 6,500 years old. Anthropomorphic figurines have been discovered in the Balkans since 6000 BC, and by around 5800 BC (in La Hoguette), these artifacts were also present in Central Europe. Among the early cultural complexes in this region, notable ones include the Sesklo culture in Thessaly, which later spread throughout the Balkans, leading to the development of cultures such as Star\u010devo-K\u00f6r\u00f6s (Cris), Linearbandkeramik, and Vin\u010da. Through a blend of cultural exchange and migration, these Neolithic practices spread westward and northward, reaching Northwestern Europe around 4500 BC. The Vin\u010da culture is often associated with creating the earliest known writing system, the Vin\u010da signs. However, according to archaeologist Shan Winn, these symbols more likely served as pictograms and ideograms rather than a fully developed writing system.", "Various theories explain the notable number of Yale University alumni who have assumed prominent roles in national politics post-Vietnam War era. Observers highlight the enduring spirit of campus activism, which has been prevalent since the '60s, along with the notable impact of Reverend William Sloane Coffin upon many future political figures. Yale President Richard Levin attributes this trend to the institution's emphasis on cultivating \"a training ground for potential leaders,\" a strategic objective that was initiated under the leadership of Yale Presidents Alfred Whitney Griswold and Kingman Brewster. In his view, this focus on leadership development began during their tenures. Former Yale College Dean and current Duke University President, Richard H. Brodhead, adds insight by pointing out Yale's strong commitment to fostering a sense of community engagement within its admissions process. He also underscores the university's longstanding tradition of student volunteerism. Historian Gaddis Smith attributes the phenomenon to a culture at Yale that encourages and fosters organized activities throughout the 20th century, contributing to the rise of leaders such as John Kerry, George Pataki, and Joseph Lieberman. Lastly, critic Camille Paglia suggests that Yale's historical context plays a role in shaping these outcomes.", "Amongst significant Canadian metropolises, St. John's holds records for being the city with the highest fog occurrences (124 days), the strongest winds (an average speed of 24.3 km/h or 15.1 mph), and the least amount of sunshine (1,497 hours). It stands out as having the most temperate winters when compared to other Canadian cities, boasting the mildest winter conditions among all Canadian cities except those in British Columbia.\n\nSt. John's experiences a steady precipitation rate throughout the year, which is often substantial. During the winter, precipitation is frequent but not always heavy, while summers generally have less rainfall, accompanied by sporadic thunderstorms. However, the wettest months occur between October and January, with December experiencing the highest single month average precipitation at around 165 millimetres. The prevalence of winter precipitation in a humid continental climate environment is uncommon, particularly one where spring or early summer would typically see the highest precipitation levels.", "In Paris, France, where the torch route was set for April 7, the event initiated at the base of the Eiffel Tower and concluded at the Stade Charl\u00e9ty. Originally planned for a 28-kilometer journey, the distance was reduced at the insistence of Chinese officials, owing to extensive demonstrations by supporters of Tibet and human rights advocates. These protesters frequently aimed to obstruct, impede, or stop the parade. As a result, a planned town hall gathering was scrapped per Chinese authorities' wishes. Furthermore, due to Chinese requests, the torch's final stage was executed via bus, not through athletes carrying it. Initially, Paris local administration intended to welcome the Olympic torch with a peaceful protest upon its arrival. The municipal government had prepared a banner stating, \"Paris champions global human rights.\"", "Across European and American surveys, green is predominantly linked to aspects such as nature, vitality, wellness, youthfulness, springtime, hope, and often envy. While it occasionally connotes death, illness, or evil in these regions due to its dual nature, in China, green significantly symbolizes fertility and joy. Historically, during the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, where clothing colors reflected one's social standing, merchants, bankers, and the upper class wore green, in contrast to the nobility who favored red. The Mona Lisa, painted by Leonardo da Vinci, sports green attire, suggesting she does not belong to noble lineage. In contemporary politics, the green benches at the British House of Commons represent Commons members, whereas the House of Lords uses red benches for its representatives. Moreover, green is traditionally indicative of safety and authorization; a green light signifies 'go ahead,' and a green card grants permanent residency.", "During this period, Libya reengaged with the global community. In 1999, confidential discussions commenced between Libya and the British administration for the restoration of diplomatic ties. In 2001, Gaddafi denounced the terrorist attacks on the United States by al-Qaeda, extending condolences to the victims and advocating for Libya's participation in the War on Terror against extremist Islamism. Despite his government's suppression of domestic Islamism, Gaddafi concurrently called for a broader implementation of Sharia law. Simultaneously, Libya reinforced its alliances with China and North Korea; Chinese President Jiang Zemin paid a visit in April 2002. After the Iraq War's impact was felt, Libya declared its abandonment of weapons of mass destruction in December 2003, dismantling its chemical and nuclear arms programs. As a result, U.S.-Libyan relations improved, leading to UK Prime Minister Tony Blair meeting Gaddafi in the Libyan desert in March 2004. The following month, Gaddafi journeyed to the European Union's headquarters in Brussels, symbolizing a heightened level of cooperation.", "In 356, Constantius commanded Liberius to be exiled to Beroea, situated in Thrace, with a deadline of three days for compliance. Alongside the order of banishment, Constantius offered extravagant gifts as incentives for Liberius to adopt an Arian viewpoint, which were promptly rejected by Liberius. These gifts included five hundred pieces of gold intended to cover his expenses during exile, an offer that Liberius declined, suggesting that he would distribute the funds among those who flatter him. Additionally, Liberius returned an equally generous gift from the empress, urging the messenger to have faith in Christ and to cease persecuting the Church of God. When attempts to deposit these gifts within the church were thwarted by Liberius, who threw them out instead, Constantius directed Liberius to appear under heavy guard before him in Milan. During a notable exchange documented by Theodoret, Liberius courageously informed Constantius about Athanasius' exoneration at Sardica, exposing the enemies as proven liars and frauds. Liberius argued that it was unjust to subject the Church to such persecution.", "The debut album, The College Dropout, was released through Roc-A-Fella in February 2004, making it to number two on the Billboard 200 charts with its lead single \"Through the Wire\" reaching number fifteen on the Billboard Hot 100, staying there for five consecutive weeks. \"Slow Jamz,\" the second single featuring Twista and Jamie Foxx, enjoyed even greater success, marking the trio's first number one hit. The College Dropout garnered near-universal praise from music critics, topping both Rolling Stone and Entertainment Weekly's lists for best album of the year. This album consistently ranks among the greatest hip-hop debuts and works by artists. \"Jesus Walks,\" the album's fourth single, contributed to increasing West's visibility; it tackles themes of faith and Christianity. Surprisingly, despite industry forecasts predicting limited success due to its overt religious content, the song still managed to reach the top twenty of the Billboard pop charts.", "The Montana Territory originated from the Organic Act, enacted by the United States on April 26, 1864. Prior to its official establishment as a territory, schools emerged as families migrated to the region. Initially, these educational institutions took the form of subscription schools, usually conducted within teachers' domiciles. The earliest recorded school occurred at Fort Owen in the Bitterroot valley in 1862, catering primarily to Native American children and dependents of Fort Owen staff, with the academic period spanning from the onset of winter until February 28, and administered by Mr. Robinson. \n\nAn additional subscription school, initiated by Thomas Dimsdale in Virginia City in 1863, entailed a weekly fee of $1.75. The Montana Territorial Legislative Assembly convened for its initial session in 1864. This assembly made significant strides by authorizing counties to impose taxes for the purpose of funding schools, thereby laying the groundwork for the establishment of public education systems.", "Self-esteem is a crucial component of identity formation, fundamentally encompassing an individual's mental and emotional appraisal of themselves. The majority of self-esteem theories underscore the universal aspiration among all genders and age groups to uphold, safeguard, and elevate their self-image. Contrary to common perception, empirical data does not substantiate a pronounced decline in self-esteem during adolescence. While self-esteem can exhibit erratic shifts, often leading to intense emotional turmoil, its foundational levels tend to remain remarkably consistent throughout this developmental phase. There is ongoing debate regarding the efficacy of broad self-esteem assessments, with many advocating for more specialized tools to gain deeper insights into the adolescent experience. Specifically, girls often experience higher levels of self-esteem in contexts of nurturing friendships, emphasizing the paramount importance of companionship that offers both social and moral encouragement.", "The historical demographic nuances of Bermuda's ethnic composition have been largely concealed due to the substantial homogenization across the past four centuries. The contemporary Bermudians, irrespective of their racial categorization as black or white, exhibit no discernible ethnic differences beyond those indicative of more recent immigrant groups. In contrast, the early 17th century presented a different picture. Initially, for a century following the settlement's inception, the majority consisted of English Protestant settlers with an English heritage, complemented by smaller numbers of Irish and Scots expatriates. These individuals were dispatched to Bermuda post-the English Civil War, during which the English invaded their lands. Notably, the Irish immigrants spoke languages often presumed to be related to Gaelic.\n\nNon-white elements of the population comprised Spanish-speaking, non-slave, resident black immigrants from the Caribbean, black slaves forcibly acquired from Spanish and Portuguese ships by Bermudian privateering expeditions, and Native Americans. This latter group primarily hailed from tribes along the Atlantic coast, including Algonquian tribes, although there may have also been a presence from distant regions such as Mexico. The demographic landscape shifted dramatically by the 19th century, witnessing the English-descended white population losing its numerical superiority. Despite this transformation, the multi-faceted historical origins of Bermuda's ethnic diversity continue to shape its cultural identity.", "Intel attempted multiple times to persuade Apple to switch the Macintosh platform to Intel's chip technology but faced unsuccessful outcomes. Apple decided that Intel's CISC architecture would not be capable of competing with RISC processors. Even though the Motorola 68040 provided equivalent functionalities to Intel's 80486 and performed significantly better on a clock-for-clock comparison, the 486 had the advantage of being able to handle higher clock speeds without overheating issues, particularly with the clock-doubled i486DX2 model, which ran the CPU logic at twice the external bus speed, granting it a notable performance edge over comparable Macintosh computers.\n\nApple's product design and engineering choices exacerbated the situation by initially limiting the 68040 to their more expensive Quadra models, whereas the 486 became widely accessible to both original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and DIY enthusiasts. By late 1991, as Apple's high-end desktop lineup shifted towards the 68040, the company was unable to", "Several notable hard rock bands from the '70s and '80s maintained thriving recording careers, as exemplified by Bon Jovi's successful release of \"It's My Life\" from their multi-platinum album Crush (2000). AC/DC followed suit with their platinum-certified album Stiff Upper Lip (2000), while Aerosmith, achieving a top-ten spot with \"Jaded,\" expanded its musical repertoire and released a blues-focused album, Honkin' on Bobo, which peaked at number five in 2004. In 2010, Heart reclaimed their chart presence with Red Velvet Car, marking them as the pioneering female-led hard rock ensemble to have top-ten albums across five decades. Reunions and subsequent tours were organized for bands such as Van Halen (with David Lee Roth in 2007, following a reunion with Sammy Hagar in 2004), The Who (postponed due to John Entwistle's passing in 2002 until 2006), Black Sabbath (under Ozzy Osbourne until 2006 and then Tony Iommi until 2010), and a one-off reunion concert by Led Zeppelin in 2007, which reignited interest in their past work.", "To ensure that electricity from distinct supply sources does not become interconnected, sections of the transmission lines are rigorously segregated. This is accomplished using Neutral Sections, commonly situated at the distribution substations and approximately halfway between them; although, they're typically utilized only periodically, with alternate sections ready to take over should a substation need to be decommissioned for maintenance, allowing uninterrupted power delivery from neighboring substations. These Neutral Sections usually comprise a stretch of grounded wire separated from the operational ones by insulation, generally ceramic beads. The design is such that an uninterrupted transition occurs between the segments to accommodate the pantograph mechanism. The grounding of this segment prevents an electric arc, which could result from connecting two live segments with differing voltages, potentially exceeding the standard system voltage and risking damage or failure in the protective circuit breakers due to the substantial current flowing through. This measure effectively prevents electrical disruptions caused by voltage mismatches.", "Carolingian art primarily served the elite within court circles and the religious institutions they patronized. Influenced by the Roman and Byzantine traditions seeking grandeur and classical ideals, it merged with the vibrant Insular art from Britain and Ireland, integrating Celtic-Irish and Germanic Anglo-Saxon decorative motifs with Mediterranean elements. This synthesis set the stage for medieval artistic conventions. Prevalent early medieval religious artifacts consist largely of illuminated manuscripts and carved ivories, reflecting craftsmanship that often accompanied precious metalwork, much of which has been lost due to conversion into other uses.\n\nMetals were the preeminent medium for art, yet only a select few pieces, including the Cross of Lothair and various reliquaries, along with exceptional examples like the Sutton Hoo Anglo-Saxon burial, the Gourdon hoards from Merovingian France, the Guarrazar find from Visigothic Spain, and the Nagyszentmikl\u00f3s cache near Byzantium, have managed to survive.", "For cotton cultivation to be successful, it necessitates an extensive frost-free duration, ample sunlight, and a balanced rainfall, typically ranging from 600 to 1,200 mm (24 to 47 inches). While soil quality needs to be substantial, particularly in nutrient content, the requirement isn't excessively stringent. Generally, these optimal conditions are fulfilled within the seasonally arid tropics and subtropics in both the Northern and Southern hemispheres. However, a significant portion of today's cotton production takes place in regions with lower precipitation levels, relying instead on irrigation for water supply. The planting cycle for a given year often commences shortly after the previous autumn's harvest. As a perennial plant, cotton is intentionally grown annually to facilitate pest management. In the Northern Hemisphere, the spring planting season spans from early February through mid-June. Notably, the region of the United States commonly referred to as the South Plains is a key area where cotton cultivation occurs.", "During Darwin's lifetime, his work was extensively translated across different languages, yet challenges emerged in conveying concepts and metaphors accurately, and certain translations reflected the personal biases of their translators. Recognizing these difficulties, Darwin personally sent presentation copies to scholars in France and Germany, seeking reputable candidates who could arrange publication with local publishers independently. His intention was for the translators to craft faithful renditions of his theories.\n\nOne such notable translator was Heinrich Georg Bronn, an esteemed naturalist and geologist. Darwin was pleased with Bronn's engagement and trust. However, Bronn's German translation, published in 1860, distorted Darwin's original intent by incorporating his own ideological perspectives. Bronn substituted \"favoured races\" with \"perfected races,\" introducing a range of contentious topics that Darwin deliberately excluded from his work. Furthermore, Bronn appended additional essays exploring the origins of life and included a chapter discussing the theological implications of evolution, inspired by his support for Naturphilosophie.\n\nIn 1862, Bronn released a revised edition of his translation, integrating elements from the third English edition and considering Darwin's suggested amendments. Unfortunately, Bronn passed away unexpectedly due to a heart attack. Despite this setback, Darwin maintained regular correspondence with Julius Victor Carus, whose improved translation of the work saw publication in 1867. Throughout this process, Darwin exhibited keen interest and involvement, ensuring his ideas were conveyed with integrity and precision.", "During the reign of the Capetian dynasty, France gradually extended its dominance over the nobility, expanding from the \u00cele-de-France region to exert influence over a broader area of the country during the 11th and 12th centuries. Their expansion was challenged by the powerful Duke of Normandy, particularly with William the Conqueror (ruled 1066\u201387) as the duke from 1035\u20131087, who in 1066, following his conquest of England, established a cross-Channel empire that persisted in various forms throughout the Middle Ages. The Normans also migrated to Sicily and southern Italy around 1059 when Robert Guiscard (died 1085) founded a duchy that eventually transformed into the Kingdom of Sicily. Under the Angevin dynasty, notably Henry II (ruled 1154\u201389) and his son Richard I (ruled 1189\u201399), the English kings managed significant territories in both England and France, lands which had been acquired by the Angevin family.", "In 2009, IGN placed the Xbox 360 as the sixth greatest video gaming console ever, within a selection of 25. Despite not being the highest-selling system in the seventh generation, the Xbox 360 was acknowledged by TechRadar as the most impactful due to its emphasis on digital content distribution and online interactions via Xbox Live, along with pioneering the concept of game achievements. PC Magazine recognized the Xbox 360 as the pioneer of online gaming, highlighting its demonstration of thriving online communities within console platforms. Following five years since its initial release, the Xbox 360 experienced a significant milestone with the introduction of the Kinect motion sensor, which became the fastest-selling consumer electronic product in history and contributed to prolonging the console's lifespan. Edge magazine positioned the Xbox 360 as the second-best console between 1993 and 2013, noting its innovative features such as its own social network, cross-game communication, weekly independent game releases, and superior versions of virtually every multi-platform game. While modern comparisons may show distinctions, such as Killzone not matching Halo's standards or Gran Turismo not equaling Forza, these elements were groundbreaking at the time.", "When Sviatoslav I, Vladimir's father, passed away in 972, Vladimir, then prince of Novgorod, faced an abrupt turn of events. Having to escape to Scandinavia in 976 due to his half-brother Yaropolk's murderous takeover of their family's realm after the demise of their brother Oleg, Vladimir sought refuge and support. In Scandinavia, Vladimir, aided by his relative, the Norwegian king Earl H\u00e5kon Sigurdsson, gathered a Viking force, which enabled him to reclaim power over Novgorod and Kiev from Yaropolk.\n\nUpon becoming the Prince of Kiev, one of Vladimir's most significant accomplishments was the pivotal event of Kievan Rus' conversion to Christianity in 988, an act that marked a profound cultural shift for the region. According to the Primary Chronicle, following his decision to adopt a new faith rather than continue with the traditional Slavic idolatry, Vladimir dispatched his esteemed counselors and warriors on diplomatic missions across Europe. These emissaries traveled to visit the Christian realms, gathering insights and knowledge about the religion before it was introduced to Kievan Rus'.", "During the conflict, Galicia experienced minimal combat, primarily owing to its early capture by the Nationalist forces led by General Franco. This strategic area remained under their control throughout the duration of the war. Although it lacked direct military confrontations, it was subject to severe repression and loss of life. The political landscape was drastically altered with the abolition of all political parties, labor unions, and even Galician nationalist groups, including the notable Seminario de Estudios Galegos. The Statute of Autonomy for Galicia was consequently nullified, mirroring similar actions taken against Catalonia and the Basque provinces when they were subsequently controlled.\n\nAs documented by Carlos Fern\u00e1ndez Santander, the death toll from these repressive measures reached at least 4,200 individuals, encompassing a diverse array of political affiliations such as republicans, communists, Galician nationalists, socialists, and anarchists. Notably, the fatalities included the civil governors of all four Galician provinces, Juana Capdevielle, the spouse of the governor of A Coru\u00f1a, and prominent figures like \u00c1nxel Casal, the Partido Galeguista mayor of Santiago de Compostela. Additionally, several key socialist leaders fell victim to these tragic circumstances.", "Non-essential fatty acids, capable of synthesis within the body from alternative sources with energy expenditure, comprise the majority. Yet, in humans, two essential fatty acids necessitate dietary inclusion due to their inability to be synthesized internally. Achieving a balanced intake of these two crucial fatty acids\u2014omega-3 and omega-6\u2014appears vital for optimal health, despite the lack of definitive proof supporting this notion. Both \"omega\" fatty acids, specifically long-chain polyunsaturated types, function as precursors to a group of substances called prostaglandins, exerting wide-ranging effects throughout the human body. In essence, they exhibit hormonal properties. Omega-3 fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), derivable from the essential omega-3 alpha-linolenic acid either synthesized by the human body or obtained from seafood, contributes to the synthesis of series 3 prostaglandins, which are somewhat anti-inflammatory. On the other hand, dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA), found in certain foods, is the precursor for series 1 prostaglandins.", "Priests serving the public were chosen by the collegia organizations. Upon being elected, they gained lifelong religious authority bestowed by the eternal divine, granting them a lifetime of influence, privileges, and immunity. Consequently, civil and religious laws set constraints on the number and type of religious positions an individual and their family could hold. Religious law was characterized by collegiality and tradition, informing political decisions, potentially overturning them, and proving challenging to manipulate for personal advantage. Priesthood carried significant costs but conferred esteemed honors. Traditionally, priests did not receive any compensation. Cult donations belonged to the deity, requiring the priest to provide cult services despite possible shortfalls in public funding. This could involve subsidizing acolytes and other cult maintenance expenses from personal finances. For those who had achieved their goals through the Cursus honorum (the career path leading to the highest Roman offices), permanent priesthood was often pursued or bestowed following a lifetime of service in military and/or political roles, ideally both.", "Beyonc\u00e9, married to Jay-Z, shared their union in a video presentation at the release event for her album 'I Am... Sasha Fierce' in Manhattan's Sony Club on October 22, 2008. This event took place a month after the album's U.S. release date of November 18, 2008. 'I Am... Sasha Fierce' marked the official introduction of Beyonc\u00e9's pseudonym Sasha Fierce, which emerged during the production of her 2003 hit song \"Crazy in Love\". The album sold 482,000 copies in its initial week, achieving the top spot on the Billboard 200 chart and enabling Beyonc\u00e9 to claim her third successive number-one album in the U.S. It contained the number-one track \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\", along with the top-five hits \"If I Were a Boy\" and \"Halo\". \"Halo\" became Beyonc\u00e9's most enduring Hot 100 single to date, contributing to her additional top-ten achievements.", "In the midst of crafting his monumental work on Natural Selection, Charles Darwin unexpectedly received a package from Alfred Russel Wallace. While stationed on the Maluku Islands (specifically Ternate and Gilolo), Wallace sent twenty pages outlining an evolutionary concept, prompted by Darwin's recent encouragement. Wallace sought Darwin's advice on whether to submit this manuscript to Charles Lyell for consideration. Surprised to find similarities with his own evolving theory, Darwin swiftly informed Lyell about this development, expressing regret for being anticipated by Wallace's insights. He immediately offered to forward Wallace's manuscript to the chosen journal and admitted that this revelation might undermine the distinctiveness of his original ideas, suggesting that they could now be seen as \"smashed.\"\n\nRecognizing the significance of this simultaneous discovery, Darwin, along with Lyell and Joseph Dalton Hooker, decided that a collaborative presentation would be most fitting. They planned to combine Wallace's contribution with excerpts from Darwin's 1844 Essay on the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection and his 1857 letter to Asa Gray. This combined effort was set to be showcased at the Linnean Society on July 1, 1858, under the title \"On the Tendency of Species to Form Varieties and Subspecies through Natural Selection or the Struggle for Existence.\"", "Approximately 13% of the residents within the extensive urban region are classified as living below the poverty threshold, as reported by a 2012 submission from GHMC to the World Bank. The city of Hyderabad is characterized by 1,476 slums housing a collective population of 1.7 million individuals; notably, 66% of these inhabitants reside within 985 slums situated in the 'core' region of Hyderabad, prior to its expansion in April 2007, whereas the remaining 34% occupy 491 suburban dwellings. It's estimated that 22% of households residing in these slums have relocated from various parts of India during the last decade of the 20th century, with 63% reporting residency durations exceeding a decade. The literacy rates in the slum communities range from 60-80% overall, and the female literacy rate specifically sits between 52-73%. Approximately one-third of these slums have established basic utility connections, with the remainder relying on publicly provided services from the government. The educational landscape comprises 405 government-operated schools, 267 schools supported by the government, and an additional 175 privately run institutions.", "Innovative specialized combat scenarios, often tailored to emphasize distinctive victory criteria, have gained prominence within contemporary wrestling, leading to the creation of unique and engaging match types. Among the more prevalent such contests is the ladder match. Central to this dynamic format, participants or team of adversaries must negotiate their way up an elevated structure\u2014typically a ladder\u2014to reach the coveted prize positioned above the wrestling arena. Victory hinges on the ability to render opponents incapacitated long enough for one wrestler to ascend the ladder and secure the prize for their faction, thereby escalating the strategic use of the ladder as an instrument in itself. The prize's nature varies widely but generally includes a championship belt, emblematic of the traditional reward, the guarantee of a future championship bout, or other valuable documents integral to the wrestlers' ambitions and interests. For example, these could offer a direct cash bonus to the victorious competitor.\n\nAnother frequently encountered special event is the battle royal\u2014a contest that initially presents a spectacle of 20 to 30 wrestlers entering the ring simultaneously. Once the match commences, the objective becomes straightforward: eliminate opponents through pinfalls or submissions until only one wrestler remains triumphant. This form of combat emphasizes raw athleticism, strategic prowess, and sheer tenacity, showcasing the competitors' abilities in a high-stakes, elimination-style tournament.", "Following Cassander's demise in 298 BCE, Demetrius, armed with a considerable troop and naval force, initiated an invasion of Macedon, seizing the Macedonian throne in 294 BCE. His conquests extended to Thessaly and a large portion of central Greece by 291 BCE. His reign faced a significant challenge when Lysimachus from Thrace and Pyrrhus from Epirus launched attacks on Macedon in 288 BCE, leading to Demetrius' defeat. Seeking refuge in central Greece with his hired soldiers, Demetrius worked on gathering support, particularly in the northern Peloponnese. He attempted to besiege Athens post their revolt against him but eventually reached a pact with the Athenians and Ptolemy, enabling him to proceed to Asia Minor to contest Lysimachus' territories in Ionia. After experiencing early victories, Demetrius was compelled to surrender to Seleucus in 285 BCE and subsequently passed away in captivity. Lysimachus, who", "Bernard de Fontenelle's \"Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds\" (1686) marked a pioneering milestone as it was the first major endeavor to articulate scientific concepts and insights in a language comprehensible to the general public, employing the vernacular and focusing on engaging readers. Aimed at women who held a fascination for scientific discourse, this publication sparked the emergence of comparable works that shared its educational and entertaining approach. Characterized by a discursive presentation, these popular texts offered clarity and accessibility that contrasted with the intricate scholarly publications and academic journals typical of the era.\n\nFor instance, Charles Leadbetter's \"Astronomy\" (1727), billed as a \"completely new work,\" promised to provide \"short and easy rules and astronomical tables\" for the benefit of readers. Similarly, the first French exposition of Newtonian principles and the \"Principia\" was introduced by Voltaire in 1738 under the title \"Elements of the Philosophy of Newton.\" Following her passing in 1756, Emile du Chatelet's rendition of the \"Principia\" further facilitated the dissemination of Newton's ideas beyond the confines of academic circles and higher education institutions.\n\nAdding another layer to this narrative, Francesco Algarotti's contributions also played a vital role in popularizing scientific knowledge among the broader populace.", "In 633 AD, the Rashidun Arabs initiated an invasion of Iran, successfully conquering the region by 651 AD, leading to a substantial shift in religious beliefs among the populace, as many transitioned from their native faiths of Manichaeism and Zoroastrianism to Sunni Islam. This culminated in Arabic replacing Persian as the official language, while Persian endured as the vernacular for everyday communication and literary pursuits. During this period, Iran played a pivotal role in fostering the Islamic Golden Age, nurturing significant advancements in science, scholarship, artistry, and philosophical thought.\n\nThe emergence of the Safavid Dynasty in 1501 brought about another monumental transformation, converting the Iranian population from Sunni Islam to Twelver Shia Islam, thereby establishing it as the state religion of Iran. This conversion from Sunnism to Shiism signified a critical turning point in both Iranian and Islamic history. Under Nader Shah's rule starting in 1736, Iran experienced its apex in territorial expansion since the era of the Sassanid Empire, momentarily claiming an empire considered among the most potent at that time. However, throughout the 19th century, Iran sustained irreversible territorial losses in the Caucasus region, territories that had long been integral to the country's identity. This series of events precipitated widespread discontent that eventually led to", "In 2002, a government report highlighted by The Guardian revealed that from 1940 through 1979, the Ministry of Defence transformed substantial sections of the country into a vast experimental zone, carrying out clandestine germ warfare tests on the populace. These initiatives involved the release of hazardous chemical substances and pathogens over expansive territories without alerting the public. The Ministry maintains that the experiments aimed to mimic the effects of germ warfare and asserts that they were innocuous. Nonetheless, families residing in areas subject to these tests are observing instances of birth anomalies and developmental disabilities among their offspring, prompting numerous calls for a public investigation. The report suggests that these endeavors impacted an estimated multi-millions of individuals, notably during a 1961-1968 phase where more than a million people in the southern English coastline, stretching from Torquay to the New Forest, were exposed to bacteria like E. coli and Bacillus globigii, akin to anthrax. This situation has led to considerable concern and inquiry about the potential long-term health impacts of these unannounced trials.", "During the early 1980s, there was a significant shift in both personnel and direction within established hard rock bands, marked by notable losses, including the passing of Bon Scott, the lead vocalist of AC/DC, and John Bonham, the drummer of Led Zeppelin. Contrary to Zeppelin's immediate dissolution, AC/DC continued under their new lead vocalist, Brian Johnson, releasing the best-selling 'Back in Black' album in 1980, which stands as the fifth most sold album in the U.S. and the second globally. Meanwhile, Black Sabbath severed ties with its original singer, Ozzy Osbourne, in 1979, bringing Ronnie James Dio from Rainbow to take over, revitalizing the band's sound and rekindling its creative and popular success, notably through their album 'Heaven and Hell' in 1980. Following his departure from Sabbath, Ozzy pursued a solo career, launching with 'Blizzard of Ozz' in 1980, which featured American guitarist Randy Rhoads. Some bands, like Queen, distanced themselves from their hard rock origins, moving towards a pop-rock style, whereas others, including", "Based on diagrams depicting a limited set of particles' interactions within spacetime, Feynman formulated a comprehensive physics model that revolved around these particles' spins and the spectrum of their fundamental forces' coupling strength. He aimed to elucidate the strong force's dynamics governing nucleons' interactions with another model called the parton model. This model functioned alongside the quark model, crafted by his colleague Murray Gell-Mann at Caltech. However, the link between the two approaches remained ambiguous, as Gell-Mann mocked Feynman's concept of partons as merely a joke. During the mid-1960s, there was widespread skepticism about quarks being genuine particles, given the statistical anomaly observed in the Omega-minus particle's composition. If it was interpreted as three identical strange quarks, it was hard to reconcile with the idea of quarks being actual entities. The Stanford Linear Accelerator's deep-inelastic scattering experiments conducted in the late 1960s, akin to Ernest Rutherford's alpha particle scattering experiment on gold nuclei, eventually provided empirical evidence supporting the existence of quarks.", "On December 13, 2013, Beyonc\u00e9, a renowned artist, unveiled her self-titled fifth studio album on the iTunes platform with no prior announcements or promotional activities. This surprise release catapulted the album to the top position on the Billboard 200 chart, marking Beyonc\u00e9's fifth consecutive number one album in the United States. This achievement is notably unique, as she became the first female artist in the chart's history to have all her initial five studio albums debut at number one. Beyonc\u00e9 was celebrated for her critical acclaim and commercial success, with her album's sales reaching one million digital copies worldwide within just six days. This feat particularly underscored the significance of the album's unconventional and unexpected release strategy. \n\nMusically, the album is an exploration of electro-R&B, delving into darker themes that were not previously addressed in her previous work, including subjects like \"bulimia, postnatal depression [and] the fears and insecurities of marriage and motherhood\". The single \"Drunk in Love\", which features Jay-Z, peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. In April 2014, following weeks of anticipation, Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z officially announced their joint On the Run Tour, which marked their first collaborative concert series.", "Before the dawn of the 20th century, medical treatments for infections hinged largely on traditional remedies. Around two millennia ago, remedies containing substances with antimicrobial characteristics were documented and utilized. Ancient civilizations, such as those of the Egyptians and Greeks, employed specific fungi and plant species or their extracts to combat infections. Laboratory experiments in the late 19th century that observed antibiosis among microorganisms paved the way for the discovery of natural antibacterials produced by microorganisms themselves. Notably, Louis Pasteur mused, \"were we to somehow exploit the antagonistic dynamics observed between certain bacteria, it could very well represent the most promising avenue for therapeutic intervention.\" The concept of 'antibiosis,' which conveys \"hostile to life,\" was coined by the French bacteriologist Jean Paul Vuillemin, serving as a moniker for this early class of antibiotics. Antibiosis's inception was documented as far back as 1877 in bacterial strains by Louis Pasteur.", "In scenarios involving multiple parties, particularly when there are three or more, it's improbable for any single party to emerge as a dominant force. Instead, parties collaborate to establish coalition governments. This pattern has characterized the political landscape of the Republic of Ireland since the 1980s, and is consistently observed at the national and state levels in Germany, alongside most local authorities. In the case of Iceland, coalition governance has been the norm since the inception of the Republic, typically involving the Independence Party alongside another party, such as the Social Democratic Alliance. Similarly, in the Republic of Ireland, after 1989, no single party has managed to govern solely. Since then, several coalition governments have been formed, with both Fianna F\u00e1il and Fine Gael holding leadership roles. Implementing political reforms tends to be smoother under a coalition government compared to systems dominated by one or two parties. When factions coexist within a traditional two-party system, this dynamic further underscores the advantages of coalition governance.", "In response to the attribution of recent climate change trends, the City of Melbourne aimed to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by the year 2020, setting a target in 2002, while Moreland City Council initiated the Zero Moreland program. However, not all metropolitan municipalities followed suit; notably, the City of Glen Eira made a decision in 2009 not to pursue carbon neutrality. Melbourne's extensive urban footprint, attributed to its high-density residential areas, contributes significantly to its status as one of the world's largest cities. This is largely due to the city's reliance on suburban sprawl, marked by a significant degree of car dependence and limited public transportation options beyond central areas. The majority of vegetation within the city is non-native, primarily of European origin, which often leads to the proliferation of invasive species and noxious weeds. The presence of urban pests, including the common myna, feral pigeons, brown rats, European wasps, common starlings, and red foxes, is another notable issue. In particular, several outlying suburbs, especially those located towards the Yarra Valley and the hills to the northeast and east, have experienced prolonged periods without regenerative fires, resulting in reduced sapling growth and an underdeveloped understory vegetation layer.", "Extending to a size of 108 meters horizontally and 120 meters vertically with a height reaching 24 meters, this palace encompasses an area of more than 77,000 square meters, amounting to approximately 830,000 square feet of space. Although this space is smaller in comparison to several other renowned palaces such as those in Madrid, Vienna, Rome, Paris, and Beijing, it still houses an extensive collection of 775 individual rooms. These include 19 state rooms, 52 primary bedrooms, 188 accommodations designated for staff, 92 offices, and an impressive 78 bathrooms. The most significant rooms are located within the piano nobile, positioned behind the west-facing garden facade at the backside of the palace. This suite of ceremonial rooms is centered around the opulent Music Room, whose grand archway serves as the focal point of the exterior appearance. Adjacent to the Music Room lie the illustrious Blue and White Drawing Rooms. These rooms are intricately connected, forming a pathway that leads to the central section of the suite, effectively linking the various state chambers.", "During the Royal Assent ceremony, which occurs within the Senate due to the sovereign's traditional exclusion from the House of Commons, the Senate's Speaker will announce to the assembly a notification from the secretary to the governor general that outlines the impending arrival of the viceregal representative or their deputy. This session cannot proceed to adjournment until the ceremony has been carried out. The Speaker moves to a position alongside the throne, with the mace bearer, carrying the mace, positioned nearby. The governor general then enters to occupy the Speaker's chair. The Usher of the Black Rod is then instructed by the Speaker to summon the Members of Parliament, who subsequently follow the Usher back to the Senate. The Sergeant-at-Arms carries the mace of the House of Commons. Within the Senate, those from the Commons stand behind the bar, while the Usher proceeds to stand next to the governor general. Upon receiving the nod from the governor general, he or she signifies Royal Assent for the presented bills, excluding appropriations bills. The process concludes once", "Meanwhile, Scotland maintained its independence as a kingdom. In 1603, the situation evolved when the Scottish monarch succeeded to the English throne, subsequently inheriting Ireland's crown as well. This period of the 17th century was marked by political turmoil, sectarian strife, and warfare. The English colonization of Ireland continued into the 16th century, extending to significant Scottish and English settlements in Ulster. Sectarian tensions escalated, and the English monarch clashed with Parliament over policies that favored Catholicism. This dispute led to the English Civil War or the conflict between the three kingdoms, resulting in a republican form of government in England. Ireland, predominantly Catholic, largely remained loyal to the king. Following the defeat at the hands of Parliament's military forces, large tracts of land were redistributed from the loyalist Irish aristocracy to English common soldiers, which initiated the formation of a new ruling class known as the Ascendancy. Over the following century, this class would eradicate the English (Hiberno-Norman) and Gaelic Irish populations.", "In the early stages of the 18th century, the Maratha Kingdom underwent a transformation, evolving into the formidable Maratha Empire governed by the Peshwas or prime ministers. This empire witnessed its apex after defeating the Mughal army in their very capital, Delhi, in the Battle of Delhi in 1737. The Maratha's subsequent conquests included the Mughals, Nizam, the Nawab of Bengal, and the Durrani Empire, all with the aim of expanding their dominion.\n\nGordon elucidated the systematic approach adopted by the Marathas to conquer new territories. Their strategy typically began with an annual raid, during which they demanded ransom from affected villages and towns. Meanwhile, the waning Mughal Empire maintained a facade of control. Ultimately, this led to a comprehensive takeover of these regions. Using the Malwa area as an illustrative example, he highlighted the Maratha's development of an efficient public administrative system that was meticulously focused on details. This system was particularly effective in generating revenues in areas that had been ravaged by raids, reaching heights of prosperity previously experienced by these regions.", "In 1939, anticipating the possibility of war against Axis nations, the Bureau initiated the creation of a list for potential custodial detention. Primarily comprising the names of prominent Issei leaders, the list expanded based on an existing Naval Intelligence index that had concentrated on Japanese Americans in Hawaii and along the West Coast. However, it also encompassed individuals of German and Italian nationalities. On December 7, 1941, while the attacks on Pearl Harbor were still unfolding, Robert Shivers, the Honolulu office's head, secured approval from Hoover to initiate the detainment of those listed. Immediately following the assault, mass arrests and home searches\u2014often without warrants\u2014were implemented across several weeks, leading to the arrest of over 5,500 Issei men by the FBI. On February 19, 1942, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066, mandating the relocation of Japanese Americans from the West Coast. Despite this order, FBI Director Hoover was opposed to it.", "The body's ability to respond to antigens is influenced by various factors including an individual's age, the nature of the antigen, maternal influences, and the location of antigen presentation. Neonates, characterized by a state of physiological immunodeficiency, exhibit significantly reduced innate and adaptive immune responses. Despite this, children generally show a more favorable response to protein-based antigens compared to those of glycoprotein or polysaccharide composition, leading to frequent neonatal infections from relatively mild pathogens such as Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas. Antigen recognition capabilities in neonates are notably limited, manifesting through decreased levels of C3 (only about 65% of adult levels) and diminished phagocytic activity. The underlying mechanisms include lower opsonizing capacity and a reduced ability for neutrophils to engage with vascular endothelial adhesion molecules due to insufficient upregulation of integrin and selectin receptors. This hampers neutrophil function, further contributing to the overall immunological challenges faced by neonates.", "Post-independence, on April 15, 1948, the Chief Commissioner's Province of H.P. was established through the amalgamation of 28 minor princely states, encompassing feudal princes and zaildars, located in the mountainous region of the western Himalayas, often referred to as the Simla Hills States, along with four hill territories from Punjab's southern region. This was executed via the Himachal Pradesh (Administration) Order, 1948, issued under Sections 3 and 4 of the Extra-Provincial Jurisdiction Act, 1947, which later underwent a renaming to the Foreign Jurisdiction Act, 1947 in accordance with the All-India Official Language Act, 1950. \n\nFurthermore, on April 1, 1954, the State of Bilaspur was incorporated into Himachal Pradesh, following the implementation of the Himachal Pradesh and Bilaspur (New State) Act, 1954. On January 26, 1950, Himachal Pradesh transitioned into a Part C state, marking its inclusion as a constituent component of the Indian Constitution.", "\"Bleacher Bums\" refers to a fan group, particularly those known for their heckling, seated in the bleachers at Wrigley Field, often found attending baseball games. The term originated from the perception that these individuals frequently attended daytime matches, presuming their lack of employment. Contrary to initial assumptions, many members were, and continue to be, college students from institutions like DePaul University, Loyola, Northwestern University, and the University of Illinois at Chicago. The phenomenon gained notable theatrical representation through a Broadway play, featuring actors such as Joe Mantegna, Dennis Farina, Dennis Franz, and James Belushi, which has been running for several years, drawing inspiration from the real-life fanbase.", "At approximately 1:17 PM Pacific Daylight Time (20:17 UTC), the torch was ignited within a park adjacent to AT&T Park, being momentarily carried by representatives from both American and Chinese Olympic delegations. However, the organized relay encountered disarray when the inaugural participant vanished into a waterfront warehouse, remaining there for nearly half an hour. This event triggered confrontations involving thousands of pro-China activists, including those who claimed they were bussed to the location by the Chinese Consulate and other pro-China entities, alongside individuals protesting for Tibet and Darfur. The non-Chinese protesters were reported to be overwhelmed and followed by enraged crowds. By around 2:00 PM PDT (21:00 UTC), the torch reappeared approximately 3 kilometers (1.9 miles) from the stadium, along Van Ness Avenue\u2014a significant commercial route\u2014 which was not part of the initial itinerary. News broadcasts exhibited the flame's journey.", "In a regular adult football game, the competition unfolds over two segments, each lasting 45 minutes, referred to as halves. These halves proceed uninterrupted, with the game clock pausing only for exceptional scenarios like the ball's departure from play. Typically, there's a 15-minute interval, known as halftime, separating these halves. The conclusion of the match is marked by \"full-time\". The authority responsible for timing the game is the referee, who accounts for any delays caused by factors such as player substitutions, medical treatments, or disruptions to the game. Additional time, adjusted by the referee to compensate for these interruptions, is referred to as \"additional time\", though it is more commonly known as \"stoppage time\" or \"injury time\". The term \"loss time\" can also denote this period. The length of this stoppage is entirely within the discretion of the referee. It's the referee who ultimately decides when the game should conclude. In games overseen by a designated fourth official, the referee might indicate their plan for adding extra time before the end of each half, after which the fourth official communicates this to the players and audience using a signboard.", "Identification of infectious agents typically occurs when it facilitates treatment or disease prevention, or enhances our understanding of illness progression before effective countermeasures are available. For instance, before the introduction of AZT for AIDS treatment in the early 1980s, analyzing patient blood samples' composition allowed tracking the disease's course, despite not offering additional therapeutic options to patients. These studies elucidated HIV's presence in specific communities, supporting theories about its transmission mechanism. Gaining insight into how HIV spread enabled the allocation of resources to high-risk communities through targeted health campaigns aiming to reduce new infection rates. The precise serological diagnosis, followed by advancements in genotypic or molecular identification of HIV, also contributed to forming hypotheses regarding the virus's temporal and geographical origins.", "Ever since regaining independence, Estonia has positioned itself as a bridge connecting Eastern and Western worlds, energetically pursuing economic transformation and integration into Western frameworks. Estonia ranks amongst the economic leaders from the former COMECON region due to its market-oriented reforms. The country notably pioneered the adoption of a flat tax system in 1994, inspired by Milton Friedman's economic theories, making Estonia one of the pioneering nations with a uniform tax rate of 26%, irrespective of individual income levels. The personal income tax rate was subsequently lowered to 24% in January 2005, further reduced to 23% in January 2006, and then decreased to 21% by January 2008. Estonia officially embraced the Euro as its national currency on the 1st of January 2011, a bit later than anticipated due to ongoing inflation issues. An additional tax known as the Land Value Tax is imposed, the proceeds of which are allocated for funding local municipalities; although it is a state-level tax, all revenues are directed towards Local Councils. The rate for this tax is determined by", "Saint Helena Island spans a total area of 122 km2 (47 square miles), characterized predominantly by rough, volcanic landscapes that emerged approximately 7 million years ago, with its last volcanic activity. Its coastal regions are distinguished by volcanic rock formations, exhibiting warmer and drier climates compared to the central areas. The island's peak, Diana's Peak, reaches an elevation of 818 meters (2,684 feet), becoming the site for its initial national park designation in 1996. Over 80% of the island is adorned with New Zealand flax, a vestige of its past industrial activities, although original trees have been bolstered through plantations, notably from the Millennium Forest project initiated in 2002 to restore parts of the Great Wood. This project is currently under the stewardship of the Saint Helena National Trust. Historically, upon discovery, the island was enveloped in distinctive native vegetation, including an exceptional type of cabbage tree. The interior of the island could have been a lush tropical rainforest, while the coastlines might have also possessed a similar level of biodiversity.", "During the mid-1980s, there was a notable resurgence in popularity among established music groups. Following an 8-year hiatus, Deep Purple, featuring their iconic lineup from the classic Machine Head era, released Perfect Strangers in 1984. This album secured a position at number five on the UK charts, attained top-five placements in several other nations, and was certified platinum in the United States due to its high sales. Subsequent to slower sales following the release of their fourth album, Fair Warning, Van Halen experienced a significant comeback with Diver Down, which peaked at number three on the album charts in 1982. This success led to their most commercially successful period with the album 1984, achieving number two on the Billboard album rankings and spawning the hit single \"Jump,\" which topped the singles chart for several weeks. Heart, after struggling in the first half of the decade, experienced a resurgence with their self-titled ninth studio album, which reached the top spot and included four Top 10 hits, with their first chart-topping song among them.", "The United States predominantly operates within a framework characterized by a two-party system. Historically, the political landscape has primarily revolved around conservative entities, exemplified by the Republican Party, and liberal forces represented by the Democratic Party. Initially, the political spectrum featured the Federalists and the Republicans, with the Republicans prevailing temporarily under a single-party governance model. A subsequent schism emerged, dividing the National Republicans and Democratic Republicans, leading to the inception of the Whig Party and the solidification of the Democratic Party.\n\nThe Whig Party, while enduring for approximately two decades, encountered significant internal strife centered on the contentious issue of slavery. Members opposing its expansion found themselves aligning with the nascent Republican Party, alongside anti-slavery Democrats. This division significantly influenced the evolution of the political landscape, resulting in a bifurcated political ideology where the two major parties, each embodying distinct philosophical underpinnings, dominate the political sphere.\n\nDespite the prevalence of a two-party system, third parties, such as the Libertarian Party, have historically received minimal support, rarely achieving electoral success. Notwithstanding their marginal presence, third parties have occasionally played pivotal roles in swaying voter preferences away from established parties. Prominent instances include Theodore Roosevelt's impact in the 1912 election and George Wallace's influence during the 1968 election. These historical events serve as poignant reminders of the potential for third parties to reshape political outcomes, albeit in instances where they have exerted substantial electoral pressure on", "In July 2013, due to significant shifts in college conference affiliations, Notre Dame restructured its involvement in sports excluding football and fencing, with fencing's arrangement undergoing adjustments in July 2014. The university transitioned from the Big East to the ACC amidst instability within the Big East, maintaining football independence while committing to an annual schedule featuring five games against ACC teams. For ice hockey, the team sought a new conference after the Big Ten's addition of the sport in 2013-14 triggered a series of conference changes that led to the dissolution of the Central Collegiate Hockey Association, where Notre Dame had previously competed. Consequently, the hockey team shifted to Hockey East. Following Notre Dame's integration into the ACC, the conference decided to incorporate fencing as a sponsored sport starting in the 2014-15 academic year. Although there are various hypotheses surrounding the origin of the university's athletics title, it is established that the \"Fighting Irish\" name was derived from a specific context.", "Regarding the 80 participants in the London torch relay, Sir Steve Redgrave, the starter, informed the press that he had received email appeals advocating for a boycott, understanding their viewpoint. Francesca Martinez and Richard Vaughan declined to participate, whereas Konnie Huq chose to take part and also expressed her disapproval of China's actions. Norman Baker, a pro-Tibetan MP, solicited all torchbearers to reevaluate their participation. Amidst opposing pressures, Prime Minister Gordon Brown greeted the torch without physically handling it, standing outside 10 Downing Street. The relay was characterized by constant protests, with 35 individuals being arrested. When the torch reached Ladbroke Grove, a demonstrator attempted to seize it from Konnie Huq during a brief struggle. Separately, a fire extinguisher was accidentally activated near the torch. Following the London events, the Chinese ambassador proceeded to carry the torch through Chinatown.", "Jerusalem, a city of profound significance to Jews, Muslims, and Christians, is renowned for its array of religiously pivotal sites including the historic Old City, which encompasses the Western Wall and the Temple Mount, the Al-Aqsa Mosque, and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. Other esteemed religious destinations in Israel include Nazareth, revered in Christianity for its connection with the Annunciation of Mary; Tiberias and Safed, two of the Four Holy Cities in Jewish tradition; the White Mosque in Ramla, considered sacred in Islam as the burial place of Prophet Saleh; and the Church of Saint George in Lod, esteemed in both Christianity and Islam as the final resting place of Saint George or Al Khidr. Additionally, several religious landmarks are found within the West Bank region, notably Joseph's Tomb in Nablus, which marks the birthplace of Jesus, and Rachel's Tomb in Bethlehem.", "Many non-alphanumeric symbols were strategically arranged to align with their positions on traditional typewriters, emphasizing their mechanical rather than electronic origin. A notable detail is that this arrangement adhered to the standard established by the Remington No. 2, the pioneering typewriter introduced with a shift key in 1878. Initially, certain symbols like \"#\" and \"$\" occupied the second column, rows 1 through 5, which corresponded to the digits 1 through 5 in the adjacent column. However, it's crucial to note that earlier models often replaced 0 and 1 with \"O\" (uppercase) and \"l\" (lowercase) letters, respectively, due to limited symbol options. Over time, as 0 and 1 became more prevalent, the symbols \"(\" and \")\" began to reflect these numerals.\n\nThe placement of some critical symbols, such as the underscore (\"_\") and parentheses, required nuanced adjustments. The space character typically occupied the position corresponding to 0, which meant parentheses could not be assigned to 9 and 0 directly. To address this, the underscore was removed from its typical position and reallocated elsewhere, ensuring a harmonious fit within the overall scheme.", "The transition into adolescence signifies a significant shift in a child's position within their family unit, where their influence over household decisions remains limited until they reach early adolescence, when they begin to be recognized by parents as peers. Balancing independence with maintaining a nurturing relationship with parents becomes the adolescent's challenge. Puberty often introduces a notable rise in conflicts between adolescents and parents, alongside a weakening of the familial bond. Disputes frequently center around minor matters of control, like setting curfews, approving attire, and acknowledging adolescents' need for personal space, aspects that they might previously have seen as subjects entirely under parental authority. As adolescents encounter new influences, particularly from their friends which sometimes contradict parental values, disagreements between parents and their teens escalate. The advent of social media has further complicated these dynamics by providing a platform where adolescents can encounter additional influences that challenge traditional parental authority. Parents now face a landscape where the risks and considerations they once managed without concern have become more complex and unpredictable.", "The microbiological culture serves as a fundamental diagnostic method for identifying infectious diseases. This process entails cultivating a growth medium tailored for a particular microorganism. A sample obtained from suspect tissue or bodily fluids is subjected to evaluation for the existence of an infection-causing agent capable of thriving within that medium. The majority of pathogenic bacteria are straightforward to cultivate on nutrient agar, a type of solid medium that furnishes essential nutrients like carbohydrates and proteins for bacterial growth, complemented by abundant water. An individual bacterium evolves into a discernible cluster known as a colony, which might appear either isolated or amalgamated into a 'lawn'. The colony's dimensions, hue, texture, and morphology distinctly characterize the bacterial species, its unique genetic configuration (the strain), and the milieu supporting its proliferation. Additional components are frequently incorporated into the plate to facilitate identification. Some plates include substances that enable the growth of specific microorganisms.", "Approximately 20% of the student body at Eton College benefits from financial aid, encompassing various scholarships and bursary programs. According to the recent headmaster, Tony Little, the institution is actively formulating strategies to ensure accessibility for all students regardless of their family's economic status. Little stated in 2011 that about 250 students received substantial financial assistance from the school. By early 2014, this number escalated to accommodate 263 students with approximately 60% of their school fees covered, and an additional 63 students were enrolled without any tuition costs. In the near term, Little aimed to provide bursaries to roughly 320 students annually and waive fees for 70 others, with the ultimate goal being to significantly expand the number of students benefiting from financial support.", "Prior to the establishment of Queen, Brian May and Roger Taylor collaborated in a group known as Smile. Recognizing their potential, Freddie Mercury, then referred to by his birth name Farrokh \"Freddie\" Bulsara, became an enthusiastic supporter, encouraging them to push the boundaries through innovative stage and recording methodologies. In 1970, Mercury integrated himself into the band, proposed \"Queen\" as an alternative moniker, and took on his celebrated stage persona. John Deacon was subsequently invited to join before the quartet embarked on the recording of their self-titled debut album in 1973. Following the modest impact of their initial albums, Queen II reached the UK charts in 1974, and subsequent releases, notably Sheer Heart Attack that same year and the seminal A Night at the Opera in 1975, catapulted them to global prominence. A Night at the Opera particularly highlighted \"Bohemian Rhapsody,\" which held the top spot in the UK charts for an impressive nine weeks, thereby pioneering the integration of music videos. Queen's 1977 offering, News of the World, is remembered for \"We Will Rock You\" and \"We Are the Champions,\" songs which have since become iconic anthems in the realm of sports events.", "On March 13th, Clydebank, located in Scotland near Glasgow, experienced severe bombing. Out of its 12,000 residences, only seven remained undamaged. Similar attacks targeted numerous other ports across the region. By the end of March, Plymouth had suffered five bombings, Belfast, Hull, and Cardiff also fell under attack. Cardiff endured bombings over three consecutive nights, whilst Portsmouth's central district was decimated due to five raids. By September 1940, an average of 40,000 civilians lost their homes each week as a result of these bombings. \n\nIn March 1941, significant raids on both Plymouth and London led to the displacement of 148,000 individuals. Despite extensive damage, British ports remained crucial for supporting the war effort and facilitating continuous shipments from North America. The Royal Navy also maintained its operations out of Plymouth, Southampton, and Portsmouth. Notably, Plymouth faced particularly severe attacks due to its vulnerable coastal location and proximity to German air bases. An aerial assault on March 10/11 resulted in 240 bombers dropping 193 tons of high explosives and 46,000 incendiary devices, causing substantial damage to homes and commercial areas.", "The origin of collegiate a cappella remains uncertain. The Rensselyrics at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, initiated in 1873, might be the oldest documented collegiate a cappella ensemble. However, the Whiffenpoofs at Yale University, founded in 1909, possibly hold the distinction of being the longest continuously active group, with Cole Porter among its former members. Over the 20th century, collegiate a cappella groups experienced growth, with several prominent historical groups emerging, such as the Tigertones at Princeton University (1946), The Colgate 13 at Colgate University (1942), Aires at Dartmouth College (1946), Cayuga's Waiters and The Hangovers at Cornell University (1968), the Maine Steiners at the University of Maine (1958), the Kingsmen at Columbia University (1949), the Jabberwocks at Brown University (1949), and the YellowJackets at the University of Rochester (1956). Following this, all-female a cappella groups were formed, often as a humorous response to their male counterparts: the Smiffenpoofs at Smith College (1936) and The Shwiffs at Connecticut College (The", "Involvement in peer groups provides adolescents with a platform to delve into their emotions and self-identity, while also nurturing and assessing their interpersonal abilities. These peer associations offer members a chance to hone skills essential for social interaction, including empathy, cooperation, and leadership. Adolescents gravitate towards groups that align with their own traits and values. Through these connections, they gain a deeper understanding of their evolving self, integrating the group's norms and values into their personal sense of identity. The process of acquiring and contemplating new communication techniques, alongside self-reflection and the perspectives of others, empowers adolescents to openly discuss emotions and other matters, free from the fear of rejection or criticism. Peer groups can exert both beneficial and detrimental impacts on individuals. They may boost academic motivation and performance, yet simultaneously pose risks through peer pressure that could lead to behaviors such as drug experimentation, alcohol use, vandalism, and theft. Sensitivity to peer influence peaks around age fourteen and subsequently diminishes. The effects of peer dynamics continue to shape adolescent behavior, underscoring the multifaceted role of peer groups in their development.", "In the wake of this political turbulence, Australia underwent an economic downturn that began in the early 1990s, leading to a surge in unemployment rates, reaching a peak of 11.4% in 1992. Amidst these challenging times, the Liberal Party experienced a rift as its former Treasurer, John Howard, challenged the incumbent leader, Andrew Peacock, for the party's top position. This period of internal strife coincided with the emergence of an ambitious new policy document titled \"Fightback!\" unveiled by the Opposition under the leadership of Dr. John Hewson. \n\nThis 650-page policy blueprint introduced a suite of radical, neoliberal reforms aimed at revitalizing the economy. Key among these measures was the introduction of a Goods and Services Tax (GST), modifications to the Medicare system that ended the practice of bulk billing for patients who did not qualify for concessions, a strict limit of nine months on unemployment benefits, significant changes to industrial relations policies including the elimination of wage-setting agreements, a substantial reduction of 13 billion dollars in personal income tax, targeted at those in the middle and upper-income brackets, cuts of $10 billion from public spending, the abolition of state-level payroll taxes, and the privatization of numerous state-owned enterprises. These steps marked a pivotal shift away from Keynesian economic management and the more conservative fiscal policies that had characterized previous administrations of the Liberal and National coalition parties.\n\nThe proposed 15% GST, in particular", "Legal dilemmas explored in Harper Lee's \"To Kill a Mockingbird,\" beyond the courtroom settings, have sparked considerable interest among legal academics. Claudia Durst Johnson highlights a notable disparity, stating that \"more scholarly articles in law journals address issues raised in To Kill a Mockingbird than those in literary journals do.\" The perspective of 19th-century essayist Charles Lamb is captured with the statement: \"Lawyers, I suppose, were children once.\" Johnson points out that in the world of Scout and Jem, child protagonists, their interactions are marred by compromise and agreements made through spitting on their palms, and family discussions often revolve around societal norms and rules. For instance, there's an inquiry about whether it's justified for Bob Ewell to hunt and trap during off-season periods. \n\nSimilarly, societal norms are often challenged or disregarded by characters operating under symbols of courts. Dolphus Raymond, who has been socially ostracized due to his open interracial relationship and family ties, embodies a character that breaks societal norms in a metaphorical \"courtroom.\" These instances demonstrate how the novel intertwines the complexities of law, morality, and social conduct within its narrative, thereby making it a rich source of discussion for both legal and literary scholars.", "In December 1975, Queen issued their album \"A Night at the Opera,\" inspired by the renowned Marx Brothers film. At the time, it was considered the most costly album ever produced. Building upon the eclectic style of their prior work, the record encompasses a variety of musical genres and showcases innovative stereo techniques. Notably, \"The Prophet's Song,\" an eight-minute composition, employs a canon technique, layering simple melodies to achieve a rich choral effect. \"Love of My Life,\" written by Mercury, includes a harp and intricate vocal harmonies. This album experienced great success in the UK and achieved triple-platinum status in the US. In a 2004 Channel 4 survey, British voters ranked it as the 13th greatest album ever. Internationally, it consistently ranks high in polls \u2013 it was deemed the 19th best overall album in a global Guinness poll, and the Australian public voted it as the 28th greatest in an ABC poll. \"A Night at the Opera\" remains a frequently celebrated piece of music history.", "The idea of Mary's Immaculate Conception was initially more prominent in the theology developed by Latin, specifically Frankish, scholars but gradually gained significance in the Byzantine region where scholars leaned heavily on the Mariology of Gregory Nazianzen. Even though terms such as \"purified\" and \"prepurified\" were regularly used by hymnographers and scholars, notably by Emperor Justinian I, to describe Mary, the detailed interpretation of Nazianzen's ideas began with Sophronius of Jerusalem. He elucidated that Mary was already immaculate at her purification during the Annunciation. He advanced the concept that John the Baptist, who had been sanctified in the womb, was still less holy compared to Mary, signifying her unparalleled holiness. Sophronius' teachings were later expanded upon and included by St. John Damascene, a significant figure until around 749/750. John, in addition to praising Mary for her purification at the Annunciation, uniquely attributed to her the power of purifying baptism water by simply touching them.", "Several demonstrations took place during the Olympic flame's journey. Participants from the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China, notably pro-democracy advocate Szeto Wah, employed novelty inflatable plastic Olympic torch replicas, symbolizing their demand for accountability regarding the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and the promotion of democratic governance in Hong Kong. Leung Kwok-hung, a political activist and Legislative Council member, also supported these protestors, expressing his pride in Hong Kong's capacity for individuals to articulate their views courageously. The crowd opposing the pro-democracy activists used derogatory terms such as \"traitor\" and \"running dog,\" urging them to leave and expressing admiration for the Communist Party. Simultaneously, approximately ten members of the Civil Human Rights Front carried orange banners advocating for enhanced human rights and universal suffrage. Mandarin speakers onlookers questioned the demonstrators' patriotism, attempting to conceal the banners with a sizable Chinese national flag. A woman was among those making these inquiries.", "Zhejiang's economy is primarily centered around manufacturing sectors including electronics, machinery, textiles, chemicals, food, and construction materials. The province has adopted a distinct development strategy known as the \"Zhejiang model,\" characterized by a strong support for entrepreneurship, a focus on small-scale enterprises capable of swiftly adapting to market fluctuations, significant state investment in infrastructure, and the mass production of affordable goods for both local and international markets. This approach has transformed Zhejiang into one of China's wealthiest regions, with the distinctive \"Zhejiang spirit\" inspiring many within the country. Nonetheless, contemporary economic analysts express concerns about the sustainability of this model. They argue that it might be inefficient and excessively burdensome on natural resources and public services. Moreover, there's a risk that the abundance of small companies in Zhejiang specializing in low-cost production may hinder progress into more complex and technologically advanced industries.", "In December, Beyonc\u00e9 joined forces with other prominent personalities to support the \"Demand A Plan\" initiative\u2014a bipartisan endeavor by approximately 950 US mayors and additional stakeholders. This campaign aimed to prompt the federal government to reconsider its gun control policies, following the tragic Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. \n\nIn 2012, Beyonc\u00e9 lent her support to the World Humanitarian Day campaign by contributing her song \"I Was Here\" and its accompanying music video, filmed at the United Nations, to raise awareness. For the year 2013, she was involved in the Gucci \"Chime for Change\" campaign alongside Salma Hayek and Frida Giannini. This campaign's objective was to promote gender equality and empower women. The campaign was unveiled through her latest music during a broadcast on February 28. \n\nThe campaign culminated in a fundraising concert held on June 1, 2013, in London, which featured other artists such as Ellie Goulding, Florence and the Machine, and Rita Ora. Prior to this event, Beyonc\u00e9 participated in a promotional video that was released on May 15, 2013, featuring herself and fellow advocates.", "Ottoman madaris, encompassing disciplines including calligraphy, rhetoric, and intellect, primarily functioned as Islamic sanctuaries for spiritual enlightenment. The overarching objective of all knowledge, particularly in spirituality, is to attain understanding of God. Religious doctrines significantly shape the valuation of various sciences; as \u0130nalc\u0131k articulates, \"beneficial are those that support religion, whereas astrology is deemed unfavorable.\" Although mathematics and logic formed part of the curriculum in these institutions, their inclusion always revolved around religious tenets. Even mathematical instruction was imbued with a religious purpose, as the clergy believed it cultivated rational thought crucial for recognizing divine revelations. Similarly, \u0130nalc\u0131k notes that philosophy was permitted only under conditions aligning with religious principles.", "Human settlement in the region we now know as Galicia began in the Middle Paleolithic era, and it derived its moniker from the Gallaeci\u2014Celtic tribes residing north of the Douro River around the final millennium BC. This area roughly aligned with the territory encompassing the Iron Age's local Castro culture. Galicia was assimilated into the Roman Empire by the termination of the Cantabrian Wars in 19 BC, transforming into a Roman province by the 3rd century AD. In 410, the Germanic tribe, the Suebi, established a kingdom headquartered in Braga (in modern-day Portugal), which was subsequently absorbed into the Visigothic realm in 585. The arrival of the Arabs in 711 marked the invasion of the Iberian Peninsula, leading to the downfall of the Visigothic kingdom. Yet, by 740, Galicia found itself integrated into the Christian realm of Asturias. Throughout the Middle Ages, the kingdom of Galicia alternated between periods governed by its own monarchs and times under the joint rule with the kingdom.", "Upon its release, Twilight Princess was highly acclaimed by numerous reviewers as the pinnacle of the Zelda franchise. Writers from notable publications like 1UP.com, Computer and Video Games, Electronic Gaming Monthly, Game Informer, GamesRadar, IGN, and The Washington Post all recognized its exceptional quality. Game Informer described it as \"extraordinarily innovative, rivaling even the most impressive cinematic achievements of Hollywood\". GamesRadar lauded Twilight Princess with \"unquestionable top-tier praise\". Cubed3 heralded it as \"the ultimate videogame experience\". Praise for the game's visuals, featuring a distinctive art style and animation, was widespread, particularly given that it was developed for the somewhat less advanced GameCube console, despite being on par with next-generation systems in some aspects. While IGN and GameSpy noted the presence of somewhat blurry textures and lower resolution characters, they also acknowledged the game's immersive atmosphere as unparalleled in previous Zelda titles. Computer and Video Games specifically highlighted Twilight Princess's world of Hyrule as the best incarnation ever created. PALGN complimented the game's cinematics, stating that \"the cutscenes are among the best\", underscoring the overall excellence of the experience.", "Located at modest elevations, Ireland's central regions and southern portions of Great Britain notably feature low-lying landscapes. Holme, Cambridgeshire, represents the lowest point within the islands, marked at -2.75 meters below sea level. Contrasting with this, the Scottish Highlands in northern Great Britain boast mountainous terrain, culminating in Ben Nevis as the islands' apex at 1,343 meters above sea level. Similar mountainous areas are found in Wales and certain sections of Ireland; however, only seven peaks exceed 1,000 meters in height. Lakes across the islands tend to be relatively small, with Lough Neagh in Northern Ireland serving as an outlier, spanning an area of approximately 150 square miles (390 km\u00b2). In terms of size, Great Britain's largest lake, measured by area, is Loch Lomond, covering about 27.5 square miles (71 km\u00b2), whereas Loch Ness holds the distinction for volume. Moreover, Loch Morar stands out as the deepest freshwater body within the British Isles, with its maximum depth reaching 310 meters (1,017 feet). Additional details regarding geographical features within these regions are available upon request.", "Post-World War II, Britain and the empire found themselves as victors, yet faced monumental challenges, both domestically and internationally. A continent that had long been the world's dominant force, Europe, was ravaged and occupied by the superpowers, the US and USSR, who now held sway over global geopolitics. Britain, heavily depleted, narrowly avoided bankruptcy in 1946 through securing a substantial $US 4.33 billion loan (equivalent to approximately $US 56 billion in 2012), the final part of which was returned in 2006. Concurrently, there was a surge in anti-colonial sentiments in territories under European control. Adding complexity, the escalating Cold War between the US and USSR overshadowed the situation. Theoretically, both superpowers were against colonialism. However, in practice, US anti-communism took precedence over anti-imperialism. Consequently, the US supported the continuation of the British Empire to prevent the spread of communism.", "Homer portrays the \"Hellenes\" as a relatively small tribe residing in Thessalian Phthia, where Achilles commanded their warriors. According to the Parian Chronicle, Phthia was considered the ancestral home of the Hellenes, marking the renaming of the people previously identified as Greeks (\u0393\u03c1\u03b1\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03af). In Greek mythology, Hellen, the forefather of the Hellenic tribes, is depicted as the son of Pyrrha and Deucalion, reigning over Phthia as one of the sole survivors post the devastating flood. This myth appears to have originated during a period when distinct Greek tribes began to form in specific regions across Greece, reflecting their shared ancestry. Aristotle refers to this collective identity as ancient Hellas.", "Indeed, the Luftwaffe retained formidable destructive capabilities. Concerning the German conquest of Western Europe, Britain harbored fears that the escalation of submarine and aerial assaults on its maritime routes would lead to substantial repercussions on the war's trajectory. Should these attacks prevail, the strategic implications would be profound. Liverpool, along with its port, emerged as a pivotal node in the transatlantic convoy system, transporting essential supplies and resources from North America. The extensive railway infrastructure further disseminated these assets across the nation. The Liverpool Blitz, with its concerted efforts against the city, yielded significant outcomes. It led to the sinking of 39,126 long tons (39,754 tonnes) of shipping, with an additional 111,601 long tons (113,392 tonnes) sustaining damage. This devastation prompted Home Security Minister Herbert Morrison to express worries about the demoralization of the populace, noting a prevalence of defeatist sentiments among civilians. Alternative data suggests that around half of the port's 144 berths were rendered inoperational, with cargo handling capacity being diminished by 75%. Roadways and rail systems were obstructed, and vessels were unable to depart the harbor. Notably, on May 8, 1941, 57 ships were completely destroyed.", "During King George V's rule, significant renovations were carried out in 1913 under the direction of Sir Aston Webb. This project involved reimagining the East Front from 1850, transforming it into a design inspired by Giacomo Leoni's Lyme Park in Cheshire. The newly redesigned facade, crafted from Portland stone, served as the central stage for the Victoria Memorial, an imposing statue dedicated to Queen Victoria positioned at the entrance to the estate. As a successor to Edward VII in 1910, George V demonstrated a more somber disposition. His reign emphasized official engagements and ceremonial duties over extravagant social events. Notably, he orchestrated performances by pioneering jazz artists, including the Original Dixieland Jazz Band in 1919\u2014the first such event for a head of state\u2014and later, Sidney Bechet and Louis Armstrong in 1932. These historic concerts garnered recognition for the palace, earning it a nomination in 2009 for a (Kind of) Blue Plaque by the Brecon Jazz Festival, acknowledging its pivotal role in promoting jazz music within the United Kingdom.", "The relative tranquility in Europe provided Napoleon with the opportunity to concentrate on affairs in his overseas territories, particularly those in France's colonial holdings. By the time of the Revolutionary Wars, Saint-Domingue had established a notable degree of political autonomy, culminating in the rule of Toussaint Louverture as de facto leader by 1801. Recognizing the potential to reclaim Saint-Domingue, which was once economically prosperous, Napoleon capitalized on the Treaty of Amiens. This treaty notably reversed the abolition of slavery in colonies, a policy initially decreed by the National Convention in February 1794, following the French Revolution.\n\nUnder the terms of the Treaty of Amiens, Napoleon conceded to British demands by refraining from abolishing slavery in colonies where the 1794 decree had not yet taken effect. The subsequent Law of May 20th, however, failed to apply to certain Caribbean colonies like Guadeloupe and Guyane, despite the potential for misuse of the peace period by rogue officials and others to restore the practice of slavery. While the Law of May 20th did not directly reintroduce slavery, it did pave the way for the resurgence of the slave trade within the Caribbean colonies.\n\nIn response to this situation, Napoleon dispatched an expedition led by General Leclerc, with the intention of re-establishing control and asserting French authority in these territories.", "The concept that Mary was entirely free from sin and thus untouched by any moral blemish since her inception was a well-recognized belief among Greek theologians in the Byzantine tradition. This perspective was first articulated by Saint Gregory Nazianzen, who drew upon the biblical account of the purification of Jesus and Mary at their circumcision (Luke 2:22) to propose that this 'purification' signified the outward manifestation of a sinlessly pure essence (akin to Jesus' glory at His baptism). He referred to Mary as \"prokathartheisa,\" or pre-purified. Gregory's innovative interpretation aimed to harmonize the Temple purification ritual with his understanding of both Jesus and Mary's holy human natures, leading to their mutual purification through divine grace and glory. It is plausible that the development of Marian worship in Constantinople, closely preceding Christmas celebrations, influenced Gregory's views on Mary's purification. His title for Mary at the Annunciation as \"prepurified\" was notably embraced subsequent to his initial use of the term.", "Until 1841, the state appeared relatively serene compared to the wider country, owing to its strong association with the United States. However, in 1843, anticipating potential conflict, the state government started reinforcing defense lines at the border with Texas. They dispatched weapons supplies to fully arm the military, while also working to enhance operational efficiency within the presidios.\n\nFurthermore, in response, the state organized the \"Regimen for the Defenders of the Border\" in 1843, consisting of light cavalry, four squadrons of two brigades each, and a smaller contingent of 14 men and 42 officials, all operating at an annual cost of 160,603 pesos. \n\nDuring the early 1840s, civilians initiated efforts to halt US supply caravans, but owing to their remote location, the caravans continued uninterrupted till March 1844. Despite the ongoing anticipation of conflict, the state's legislative body, on July 11, 1846, by decree, called for the enlistment of 6,000 additional men.", "In May 1800, Napoleon and his forces traversed the Swiss Alps towards Italy with the objective of catching the Austrian armies off guard, who had recently reclaimed the peninsula while Napoleon was in Egypt. Despite facing significant challenges during their crossing, the French forces easily advanced onto the Italian plains. Meanwhile, a contingent of Austrians, preoccupied elsewhere, were engaged in a siege of Genoa, which was being effectively contested by a sizable French army led by Andr\u00e9 Mass\u00e9na. This determined resistance by Mass\u00e9na's troops provided crucial time for the northern assault, enabling the main forces to operate largely unimpeded.\n\nFollowing an extended period of searching for each other, the two armies clashed on June 14 at the Battle of Marengo. General Alexander Melas held a numerical superiority, deploying approximately 30,000 soldiers, compared to Napoleon's 24,000 French troops. Initially, the Austrians' offensive caught the French off guard and pushed them steadily back. Melas deduced that victory was within reach.", "In Homer's epic poem, the Iliad, the terms Danaans (\u0394\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03bf\u03af) and Argives (\u0391\u03c1\u03b3\u03b5\u03af\u03bf\u03b9) denote the Greek armies engaged against the Trojans. A foundational saga pertaining to Danaus, an Egyptian figure, intertwines with the narrative as it pertains to Argos. The tale of Danaus's daughters, known as the Danaides, is bound to Tartarus where they perpetually carry water-filled jars for a bathtub without any base\u2014a task unwinnable akin to Sisyphus's eternal labor. The etymology of the name could trace back to the Indo-European root *danu*, meaning 'river'. The precise source of these names remains obscure, defying a definitive explanation.\n\nTheories suggest that the Danaans might have been associated with the Denyen, one of the sea raiding groups that targeted Egypt under Pharaoh Ramesses III's rule (1187-1156 BCE). An inscription during this period also references the Weshesh, possibly equating them to the Achaeans. The Denyen are thought to have originated from Adana, a settlement located in Cilicia. Comparable pottery styles further support the connection between these entities and the Achaeans, suggesting a shared cultural heritage or historical lineage.", "In 1969, Arnold Schwarzenegger encountered Barbara Outland, an English educator whom he cohabited with till 1974. As recounted by Schwarzenegger in his autobiography in 1977, \"Fundamentally, the issue was this: she yearned for a stable, typical existence, while I wasn't balanced, and abhorred the concept of a routine life.\" According to Baker, Schwarzenegger was \"[an] effervescent character, overwhelmingly alluring, daring, and physically active,\" yet she asserts that toward the end of their relationship, he turned \"incredibly arrogant - thinking the universe revolved around him.\"\n\nBaker released her account in 2006 under the title \"Arnold and Me: In the Veil of the Austrian Oak.\" Despite occasionally portraying Schwarzenegger negatively, he helped draft a preface for the tell-all book and even spent three hours meeting with Baker. Baker recounts, for instance, discovering Schwarzenegger's infidelities post-breakup, and describes the tumultuous nature of their connection.", "The environment of a teenager significantly influences their development of self-identity. Despite the fact that most research on adolescents focuses on those from middle-class, white backgrounds, it appears that individuals with more advantageous upbringings tend to develop their identities more successfully. The creation of an adolescent's identity marks a pivotal phase in their life. Recent findings indicate that societal trends are extending the period of transition into adulthood, making the adolescent phase, encompassing both late adolescence and early adulthood, more salient in the lifespan. This shift has elevated the importance of several factors during this developmental stage, including commitment, coping strategies, and social media usage. These elements are all influenced by the environment in which a teenager is raised. A child in a more affluent setting typically encounters a greater array of opportunities and superior conditions overall.", "Thuringia showcases a varied topography. Its northern expanse is marked by the Harz mountains, succeeded by the agriculturally rich Golden Aue, a fertile floodplain centered on Nordhausen, with the Helme River as its principal waterway. The northern-western segment comprises the Eichsfeld, a region characterized by rolling hills and at times, wooded expanses, from which the Leine river originates. The central-northern portion of Thuringia is delineated by the vast, fertile Thuringian Basin, covering approximately 3000 square kilometers, centered around the Unstrut river and encompassed by successive hill formations (proceeding clockwise from the northwest): D\u00fcn, Hainleite, Windleite, Kyffh\u00e4user, Hohe Schrecke, Schm\u00fccke, Finne, Ettersberg, Steigerwald, Thuringian Forest, H\u00f6rselberge, and Hainich. Embedded within the Basin, there are smaller hill chains such as Fahner H\u00f6he and Heilinger H\u00f6hen. To the south of the Thuringian Basin lies the region's largest mountainous area, featuring the Thuringian Forest to the northwest, the Thuringian Highland in the center, and the Franconian", "The formation and evolution of adolescent connections with peers, family, and societal influences profoundly impact their social growth. As adolescents refine their ability to differentiate between friends and casual acquaintances, their emotional investment in friendships intensifies. This attachment isn't inherently negative, yet it becomes perilous when friends introduce them to hazardous activities or environments. Adolescence marks a pivotal phase in social development because it's during this time that individuals are most susceptible to the influence of those they form close bonds with. It's here that individuals start making choices independently for the first time, making this period particularly delicate. The significance of relationships in an adolescent's social development lies in the immense sway their peers exert over them. As these connections take on greater importance, they assist adolescents in grasping fundamental social concepts.", "In June 2013, Kanye West and reality TV star Kim Kardashian publicly announced the birth of their daughter, North. Following this, their engagement was announced in October 2013, capturing significant media attention. In November 2013, West shared his plans for starting work on his upcoming studio album, aiming for a release in mid-2014, with contributions from producers Rick Rubin and Q-Tip. That December, Adidas unveiled a partnership with West, set to introduce collaborative apparel collections the following year. On May 2014, West and Kardashian tied the knot in a private Italian ceremony, joined by numerous celebrities and musicians. West commemorated their marriage with the release of \"Only One,\" a track he featured alongside Paul McCartney, on New Year's Eve 2014. \"FourFiveSeconds,\" a collaborative effort with Rihanna and McCartney, saw its launch in January 2015. Additionally, West made an appearance on the Saturday Night Live 40th Anniversary Special, unveiling a new song titled \"Wolves,\" co-starring Sia Furler.", "Contemporary rock artists occasionally incorporate mandolins into their performances, particularly electrics with a single string as opposed to the traditional double-stringed acoustic variety. A notable case is Tim Brennan from the Irish-American punk rock group, Dropkick Murphys, who adds to the ensemble's sound with his skills on the electric guitar, bass, drums, alongside instruments typical to Celtic music like the mandolin, tin whistle, and Great Highland bagpipes. Their choice of these instruments is meant to complement their signature gruff tone. Peter Buck, the guitarist of 1990s iconic band R.E.M., utilized the mandolin to propel the hit song \"Losing My Religion\" in 1991 with its distinctive few chords, which he also employed in nearly a dozen other tracks. This song reached No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, taking the top spot on the rock and alternative charts. Luther Dickinson, a member of both North Mississippi Allstars and The Black Crowes, frequently employs the mandolin in his work, most famously in", "In ecological terms, predators frequently occupy dual roles: they serve as the meal source for other organisms while also being prey themselves. For instance, despite primarily targeting insects, blue jays find their place at the mercy of predators like cats and snakes, illustrating the cyclical nature of predation. Similarly, snakes might become victims to hawks. Trophic levels provide a systematic classification for these predator relationships, with organisms that feed on plants referred to as herbivores or primary consumers, and those that target other animals classified as secondary consumers. Typically, secondary consumers are carnivores, yet a further layer exists with tertiary consumers feeding off them, followed by quartary consumers targeting the tertiary ones. The energy transfer efficiency across these hierarchical levels is notably low, necessitating a natural limit to this chain of predation, which rarely exceeds more than five or six levels. In some cases, this system might even terminate at just three trophic levels, such as a lion that sustains itself by hunting large herbivores like wildebeest.", "In 680 CE, following Ibn al-Zubayr's departure from Medina to Mecca, a significant development unfolded in Kufa. Sensing Husayn's dissent against Yazid I, the inhabitants of Kufa reached out to Husayn, inviting him to assume leadership with their endorsement. Husayn dispatched his cousin, Muslim bin Agail, to ascertain the genuineness of their invitation. Upon learning of these events, Yazid I counteracted by dispatching Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad, the governor of Basrah, with explicit orders to thwart any attempt by Kufa's populace to align themselves with Husayn. \n\nUbayd-Allah bin Ziyad successfully dispersed the assembly gathered around Muslim bin Agail and secured his capture. Recognizing Ubayd-Allah's directive aimed at obstructing Husayn's potential establishment of support in Kufa, Muslim bin Agail sought permission for a message to be conveyed to Husayn, urging him to refrain from migrating to Kufa. Unfortunately, his appeal was rejected, and this led to further confrontation between the parties involved.", "On September 1, 1870, the conflict began when the French forces, comprising 202 infantry units, 80 cavalry regiments, and 564 artillery pieces, initiated an assault on the encircling Prussian Third and Meuse Armies, which had a combined strength of 222 infantry battalions, 186 cavalry squadrons, and 774 guns. The reserve French V Corps, led by General de Wimpffen, aimed to mount a joint infantry and cavalry counterattack against the Prussian XI Corps. However, by 11:00, the Prussian artillery inflicted significant damage on the French lines as reinforcements from the Prussians reached the battlefield. General Marguerite, the French cavalry commander, attempted three bold assaults on the village of Floing where the Prussian XI Corps was concentrated. Sadly, Marguerite perished during the initial charge, and subsequent attempts failed to achieve any meaningful impact due to heavy casualties. By the day's end, with the prospect of a breakthrough all but extinguished, the battle concluded."]}
