        "Like the reptiles, birds are primarily uricotelic, that is, their kidneys extract nitrogenous waste from their bloodstream and excrete it as uric acid instead of urea or ammonia through the ureters into the intestine. Birds do not have a urinary bladder or external urethral opening and (with exception of the ostrich) uric acid is excreted along with feces as a semisolid waste. However, birds such as hummingbirds can be facultatively ammonotelic, excreting most of the nitrogenous wastes as ammonia. They also excrete creatine, rather than creatinine like mammals. This material, as well as the output of the intestines, emerges from the bird's cloaca. The cloaca is a multi-purpose opening: waste is expelled through it, most birds mate by joining cloaca, and females lay eggs from it. In addition, many species of birds regurgitate pellets. Males within Palaeognathae (with the exception of the kiwis), the Anseriformes (with the",
        "Mammalian hair, also known as pelage, can vary in color between populations, organisms within a population, and even on the individual organism. Light-dark color variation is common in the mammalian taxa. Sometimes, this color variation is determined by age variation, however, in other cases, it is determined by other factors. Selective pressures, such as ecological interactions with other populations or environmental conditions, often lead to the variation in mammalian coloration. These selective pressures favor certain colors in order to increase survival. Camouflage is thought to be a major selection pressure shaping coloration in mammals, although there is also evidence that sexual selection, communication, and physiological processes may influence the evolution of coloration as well. Camouflage is the most predominant mechanism for color variation, as",
        "Education in Israel is highly valued in the national culture with its historical values dating back to Ancient Israel and was viewed as one fundamental blocks of ancient Israelite life. Israeli culture views higher education as the key to higher mobility and socioeconomic status in Israeli society. The emphasis of education within Israeli society goes to the gulf within the Jewish diaspora from the Renaissance and Enlightenment Movement all the way to the roots of Zionism in the 1880s. Jewish communities in the Levant were the first to introduce compulsory education for which the organized community, not less than the parents, was responsible for the education of the next generation of Jews. With contemporary Jewish culture's strong emphasis, promotion of scholarship and learning and the strong propensity to promote cultivation of intellectual pursuits as well as the nations high university educational attainment rate exemplifies how highly Israeli society values higher education. The Israeli education system has been praised",

        "Following the fall of Wu and the turmoil of the Wu Hu uprising against the Jin dynasty (265\u2013420), most of elite Chinese families had collaborated with the non-Chinese rulers and military conquerors in the north. Some may have lost social privilege, and took refugee in areas south to Yangtze River. Some of the Chinese refugees from north China might have resided in areas near Hangzhou. For example, the clan of Zhuge Liang (181\u2013234), a chancellor of the state of Shu Han from Central Plain in north China during the Three Kingdoms period, gathered together at the suburb of Hangzhou, forming an exclusive, closed village Zhuge Village (Zhege Cun), consisting of villagers all with family name \"Zhuge\". The village has intentionally isolated itself from the surrounding communities for centuries to this day, and only recently came to be known in public. It suggests that a small number of powerful, elite Chinese refugees from the Central Plain might have taken refugee in",
        "The '98 season would begin on a somber note with the death of legendary broadcaster Harry Caray. After the retirement of Sandberg and the trade of Dunston, the Cubs had holes to fill and the signing of Henry Rodr\u00edguez, known affectionately as \"H-Rod\" to bat cleanup provided protection for Sammy Sosa in the lineup, as Rodriguez slugged 31 round-trippers in his first season in Chicago. Kevin Tapani led the club with a career high 19 wins, Rod Beck anchored a strong bullpen and Mark Grace turned in one of his best seasons. The Cubs were swamped by media attention in 1998, and the team's two biggest headliners were Sosa and rookie flamethrower Kerry Wood. Wood's signature performance was one-hitting the Houston Astros, a game in which he tied the major league record of 20 strikeouts in nine innings. His torrid strikeout numbers earned Wood the nickname \"Kid K,\" and ultimately earned him the 1998 NL Rookie of the Year award. Sosa caught fire in June, hitting a major league record 20 home runs in the",
        "In contemporary society, adolescents also face some risks as their sexuality begins to transform. While some of these, such as emotional distress (fear of abuse or exploitation) and sexually transmitted infections/diseases (STIs/STDs), including HIV/AIDS, are not necessarily inherent to adolescence, others such as teenage pregnancy (through non-use or failure of contraceptives) are seen as social problems in most western societies. One in four sexually active teenagers will contract an STI. Adolescents in the United States often chose \"anything but intercourse\" for sexual activity because they mistakenly believe it reduces the risk of STIs. Across the country, clinicians report rising diagnoses of herpes and human papillomavirus (HPV), which can cause genital warts, and is now thought to affect 15 percent",
        "Throughout the history of the South Slavs, the vernacular, literary, and written languages (e.g. Chakavian, Kajkavian, Shtokavian) of the various regions and ethnicities developed and diverged independently. Prior to the 19th century, they were collectively called \"Illyric\", \"Slavic\", \"Slavonian\", \"Bosnian\", \"Dalmatian\", \"Serbian\" or \"Croatian\". As such, the term Serbo-Croatian was first used by Jacob Grimm in 1824, popularized by the Vienna philologist Jernej Kopitar in the following decades, and accepted by Croatian Zagreb grammarians in 1854 and 1859. At that time, Serb and Croat lands were still part of the Ottoman and Austrian Empires. Officially, the language was called variously Serbo-Croat, Croato-Serbian, Serbian and Croatian, Croatian and Serbian, Serbian or Croatian, Croatian or Serbian. Unofficially, Serbs and Croats typically called the language \"Serbian\" or \"Croatian\", respectively, without implying a distinction between the two, and again in independent Bosnia and Herzegovina, \"Bosnian\", \"Croatian\", and \"Serbian\" were considered to be three names of a single",
        "Identity development is a stage in the adolescent life cycle. For most, the search for identity begins in the adolescent years. During these years, adolescents are more open to 'trying on' different behaviours and appearances to discover who they are. In other words, in an attempt to find their identity and discover who they are adolescents are liking to cycle through a number of identities to find one that suits them best. But, developing and maintaining identity (in adolescent years) is a difficult task due to multiple factors such as family life, environment, and social status. Empirical studies suggest that this process might be more accurately described as identity development, rather than formation, but confirms a normative process of change in both content and structure of",
        "The vast Seleucid Empire was, like Egypt, mostly dominated by a Greco-Macedonian political elite. The Greek population of the cities who formed the dominant elite were reinforced by emigration from Greece. These cities included newly founded colonies such as Antioch, the other cities of the Syrian tetrapolis, Seleucia (north of Babylon) and Dura-Europos on the Euphrates. These cities retained traditional Greek city state institutions such as assemblies, councils and elected magistrates, but this was a facade for they were always controlled by the royal Seleucid officials. Apart from these cities, there were also a large number of Seleucid garrisons (choria), military colonies (katoikiai) and Greek villages (komai) which the Seleucids planted throughout the empire to cement their rule. This 'Greco-Macedonian' population (which also",

This becomes increasing challenging in stigmatized jobs or \"dirty work\" (Hughes, 1951). Tracy and Trethewey (2005) state that \"individuals gravitate toward and turn away from particular jobs depending in part, on the extent to which they validate a \"preferred organizational self\" (Tracy & Tretheway 2005, p. 169).

        "Emotions can motivate social interactions and relationships and therefore are directly related with basic physiology, particularly with the stress systems. This is important because emotions are related to the anti-stress complex, with an oxytocin-attachment system, which plays a major role in bonding. Emotional phenotype temperaments affect social connectedness and fitness in complex social systems (Kurt Kortschal 2013). These characteristics are shared with other species and taxa and are due to the effects of genes and their continuous transmission. Information that is encoded in the DNA sequences provides the blueprint for assembling proteins that make up our cells. Zygotes require genetic information from their parental germ cells, and at every speciation event, heritable traits that have enabled its ancestor to",
        "Stanley Schachter formulated his theory on the earlier work of a Spanish physician, Gregorio Mara\u00f1\u00f3n, who injected patients with epinephrine and subsequently asked them how they felt. Interestingly, Mara\u00f1\u00f3n found that most of these patients felt something but in the absence of an actual emotion-evoking stimulus, the patients were unable to interpret their physiological arousal as an experienced emotion. Schachter did agree that physiological reactions played a big role in emotions. He suggested that physiological reactions contributed to emotional experience by facilitating a focused cognitive appraisal of a given physiologically arousing event and that this appraisal was what defined the subjective emotional experience. Emotions were thus a result of two-stage process: general physiological arousal, and experience of emotion. For example, the physiological arousal, heart pounding, in a response to an evoking stimulus, the sight of a bear in the kitchen.",
        "The political turmoil continued. John began to explore an alliance with the French king Philip II, freshly returned from the crusade. John hoped to acquire Normandy, Anjou and the other lands in France held by Richard in exchange for allying himself with Philip. John was persuaded not to pursue an alliance by his mother. Longchamp, who had left England after Walter's intervention, now returned, and argued that he had been wrongly removed as justiciar. John intervened, suppressing Longchamp's claims in return for promises of support from the royal administration, including a reaffirmation of his position as heir to the throne. When Richard still did not return from the crusade, John began to assert that his brother was dead or otherwise permanently lost. Richard had in fact been captured en route to England by the Duke of Austria and was handed over to Emperor Henry VI, who held him for ransom. John seized the opportunity and went",
        "Early Modern universities initially continued the curriculum and research of the Middle Ages: natural philosophy, logic, medicine, theology, mathematics, astronomy (and astrology), law, grammar and rhetoric. Aristotle was prevalent throughout the curriculum, while medicine also depended on Galen and Arabic scholarship. The importance of humanism for changing this state-of-affairs cannot be underestimated. Once humanist professors joined the university faculty, they began to transform the study of grammar and rhetoric through the studia humanitatis. Humanist professors focused on the ability of students to write and speak with distinction, to translate and interpret classical texts, and to live honorable lives. Other scholars within the university were affected by the humanist approaches to learning and their linguistic expertise in relation to ancient texts, as well as the ideology that advocated the ultimate importance of those texts. Professors of medicine such as Niccol\u00f2 Leoniceno, Thomas Linacre and William Cop were often trained in and taught from a humanist perspective as",

In 1861, Mayor Fernando Wood called on the aldermen to declare independence from Albany and the United States after the South seceded, but his proposal was not acted on. Anger at new military conscription laws during the American Civil War (1861\u20131865), which spared wealthier men who could afford to pay a $300 (equivalent to $5,766 in 2016) commutation fee to hire a substitute, led to the Draft Riots of 1863, whose most visible participants were ethnic Irish working class. The situation deteriorated into attacks on New York's elite, followed by attacks on black New Yorkers and their property after fierce competition for a decade between Irish immigrants and blacks for work. Rioters burned the Colored Orphan Asylum to the ground, but more than 200 children escaped harm due to efforts of the",
        "But in the mid-18th century, during the French Enlightenment, a more ideological use of the term had come into use. In 1765, the author of an anonymous article in a French Enlightenment periodical spoke of \"The general love of humanity ... a virtue hitherto quite nameless among us, and which we will venture to call 'humanism', for the time has come to create a word for such a beautiful and necessary thing\". The latter part of the 18th and the early 19th centuries saw the creation of numerous grass-roots \"philanthropic\" and benevolent societies dedicated to human betterment and the spreading of knowledge (some Christian, some not). After the French Revolution, the idea that human virtue could be created by human reason alone independently from traditional religious institutions, attributed by opponents of the Revolution to Enlightenment philosophes such as Rousseau, was violently",
        "The result was a sequence of innovative but unpopular financial measures.[nb 10] John levied scutage payments eleven times in his seventeen years as king, as compared to eleven times in total during the reign of the preceding three monarchs. In many cases these were levied in the absence of any actual military campaign, which ran counter to the original idea that scutage was an alternative to actual military service. John maximised his right to demand relief payments when estates and castles were inherited, sometimes charging enormous sums, beyond barons' abilities to pay. Building on the successful sale of sheriff appointments in 1194, John initiated a new round of appointments, with the new incumbents making back their investment through increased fines and penalties, particularly in the forests. Another innovation of Richard's, increased charges levied on widows who wished to remain single, was expanded under John. John continued to sell charters for new towns, including",
        "A number of novel ideas about religion developed with the Enlightenment, including Deism and talk of atheism. Deism, according to Thomas Paine, is the simple belief in God the Creator, with no reference to the Bible or any other miraculous source. Instead, the Deist relies solely on personal reason to guide his creed, which was eminently agreeable to many thinkers of the time. Atheism was much discussed, but there were few proponents. Wilson and Reill note that, \"In fact, very few enlightened intellectuals, even when they were vocal critics of Christianity, were true atheists. Rather, they were critics of orthodox belief, wedded rather to skepticism, deism, vitalism, or perhaps pantheism.\" Some followed Pierre Bayle and argued that atheists could indeed be moral men. Many others like Voltaire held that without belief in a God who punishes evil, the moral order of society was undermined. That is, since atheists gave themselves to no Supreme Authority and no law, and had no fear of",
        "Sleep does not affect acquisition or recall while one is awake. Therefore, sleep has the greatest effect on memory consolidation. During sleep, the neural connections in the brain are strengthened. This enhances the brain\u2019s abilities to stabilize and retain memories. There have been several studies which show that sleep improves the retention of memory, as memories are enhanced through active consolidation. System consolidation takes place during slow-wave sleep (SWS). This process implicates that memories are reactivated during sleep, but that the process doesn\u2019t enhance every memory. It also implicates that qualitative changes are made to the memories when they are transferred to long-term store during sleep. When you are sleeping, the hippocampus replays the events of the day for the neocortex. The neocortex then reviews and processes memories, which moves them into long-term memory. When you do not get enough sleep it makes it more difficult to learn as these neural connections are not as strong, resulting in a lower",
        "Although people often think that memory operates like recording equipment, it is not the case. The molecular mechanisms underlying the induction and maintenance of memory are very dynamic and comprise distinct phases covering a time window from seconds to even a lifetime. In fact, research has revealed that our memories are constructed. People can construct their memories when they encode them and/or when they recall them. To illustrate, consider a classic study conducted by Elizabeth Loftus and John Palmer (1974) in which people were instructed to watch a film of a traffic accident and then asked about what they saw. The researchers found that the people who were asked, \"How fast were the cars going when they smashed into each other?\" gave higher estimates than those who were asked, \"How fast were the cars going when they hit each other?\" Furthermore, when asked a week later whether they have seen broken glass in the film, those who had been asked the question with smashed were twice more likely to report that they have seen broken",

The kingdom of Yue began to appear in the chronicles and records written during the Spring and Autumn Period. According to the chronicles, the kingdom of Yue was located in northern Zhejiang. Shiji claims that its leaders were descended from the Shang founder Yu the Great. Evidence suggests that Baiyue and the kingdom of Yue possessed their own culture and history that are different from those kingdoms in north and central China, whose cultures and histories were carefully recorded in chronicles and histories during the Spring and Autumn Period and into the Qin dynasty.

        "Protestantism also spread from the German lands into France, where the Protestants were nicknamed Huguenots. Calvin continued to take an interest in the French religious affairs from his base in Geneva. He regularly trained pastors to lead congregations there. Despite heavy persecution, the Reformed tradition made steady progress across large sections of the nation, appealing to people alienated by the obduracy and the complacency of the Catholic establishment. French Protestantism came to acquire a distinctly political character, made all the more obvious by the conversions of nobles during the 1550s. This established the preconditions for a series of conflicts, known as the French Wars of Religion. The civil wars gained impetus with the sudden death of Henry II of France in 1559. Atrocity and outrage became the defining characteristics of the time, illustrated at their most intense in the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre of August 1572, when the Roman Catholic party annihilated between 30,000 and 100,000 Huguenots across France. The wars",

These exhibition games, most of which are held in the month of August, are played for the purpose of helping coaches narrow down the roster from the offseason limit of 90 players to the regular-season limit of 53 players. While the scheduling formula is not as rigid for preseason games as they are for the regular season, there are numerous restrictions and traditions that limit the choices of preseason opponents; teams are also restricted on what days and times they can play these games.

Madison issued four religious proclamations while President, but vetoed two bills on the grounds they violated the first amendment. On the other hand, both Jefferson and Madison attended religious services at the Capitol.

        "The works of Virgil almost from the moment of their publication revolutionized Latin poetry. The Eclogues, Georgics, and above all the Aeneid became standard texts in school curricula with which all educated Romans were familiar. Poets following Virgil often refer intertextually to his works to generate meaning in their own poetry. The Augustan poet Ovid parodies the opening lines of the Aeneid in Amores 1.1.1\u20132, and his summary of the Aeneas story in Book 14 of the Metamorphoses, the so-called \"mini-Aeneid\", has been viewed as a particularly important example of post-Virgilian response to the epic genre. Lucan's epic, the Bellum Civile has been considered an anti-Virgilian epic, disposing with the divine mechanism, treating historical events, and diverging drastically from Virgilian epic practice. The Flavian poet Statius in his 12-book epic Thebaid engages closely with the poetry of Virgil; in his epilogue he advises his poem not to \"rival the divine Aeneid, but follow afar and ever venerate its footsteps.\" In Silius Italicus, Virgil",

Eastland believes that the founders of affirmative action did not anticipate how the benefits of affirmative action would go to those who did not need it, mostly middle class minorities. Additionally, she argues that affirmative action carries with it a stigma that can create feelings of self-doubt and entitlement in minorities. Eastland believes that affirmative action is a great risk that only sometimes pays off, and that without it we would be able to compete more freely with one another. Libertarian economist Thomas Sowell identified what he says are negative results of affirmative action in his book, Affirmative Action Around the World: An Empirical Study.

        "By far the largest military action in which the United States engaged during this era was the War of 1812. With Britain locked in a major war with Napoleon's France, its policy was to block American shipments to France. The United States sought to remain neutral while pursuing overseas trade. Britain cut the trade and impressed seamen on American ships into the Royal Navy, despite intense protests. Britain supported an Indian insurrection in the American Midwest, with the goal of creating an Indian state there that would block American expansion. The United States finally declared war on the United Kingdom in 1812, the first time the U.S. had officially declared war. Not hopeful of defeating the Royal Navy, the U.S. attacked the British Empire by invading British Canada, hoping to use captured territory as a bargaining chip. The invasion of Canada was a debacle, though concurrent wars with Native Americans on the western front (Tecumseh's War and the Creek War) were more successful.

The Qing court sent forces to defeat Yaqub Beg and Xinjiang was reconquered, and then the political system of China proper was formally applied onto Xinjiang.

Prior to that time BYU teams competed in the Western Athletic Conference. All teams are named the \"Cougars\", and Cosmo the Cougar has been the school's mascot since 1953. The school's fight song is the Cougar Fight Song. Because many of its players serve on full-time missions for two years (men when they're 18, women when 19), BYU athletes are often older on average than other schools' players. The NCAA allows students to serve missions for two years without subtracting that time from their eligibility period.

He responded by attempting to punish Innocent personally and to drive a wedge between those English clergy that might support him and those allying themselves firmly with the authorities in Rome. John seized the lands of those clergy unwilling to conduct services, as well as those estates linked to Innocent himself; he arrested the illicit concubines that many clerics kept during the period, only releasing them after the payment of fines; he seized the lands of members of the church who had fled England, and he promised protection for those clergy willing to remain loyal to him. In many cases, individual institutions were able to negotiate terms for managing their own properties and keeping the produce of their estates. By 1209 the situation showed no signs of resolution, and Innocent threatened to excommunicate John if he did not acquiesce to Langton's appointment. When this threat failed, Innocent",

The popular description of the order was: \"To keep the hair, you lose the head; To keep your head, you cut the hair.\" To the Manchus, this policy was a test of loyalty and an aid in distinguishing friend from foe. For the Han Chinese, however, it was a humiliating reminder of Qing authority that challenged traditional Confucian values. The Classic of Filial Piety (Xiaojing) held that \"a person's body and hair, being gifts from one's parents, are not to be damaged.\" Under the Ming dynasty, adult men did not cut their hair but instead wore",

An exclusive boundary arises, for example, when a person adopts a marker that imposes restrictions on the behaviour of others. An inclusive boundary is created, by contrast, by the use of a marker with which other people are ready and able to associate. At the same time, however, an inclusive boundary will also impose restrictions on the people it has included by limiting their inclusion within other boundaries. An example of this is the use of a particular language by a newcomer in a room full of people speaking various languages. Some people may understand the language used by this person while others may not. Those who do not understand it might take the newcomer's use of this particular language merely as a neutral sign of identity.

In the UK, Nicole records, made of celluloid or a similar substance coated onto a cardboard core disc, were produced for a few years beginning in 1904, but they suffered from an exceptionally high level of surface noise. In the United States, Columbia Records introduced flexible, fiber-cored \"Marconi Velvet Tone Record\" pressings in 1907, but the advantages and longevity of their relatively noiseless surfaces depended on the scrupulous use of special gold-plated Marconi Needles and the product was not a success. Thin, flexible plastic records such as the German Phonycord and the British Filmophone and Goodson records appeared around 1930 but also did not last long.

The date of the assignment was retroactively established on Armistice Day. It is doubtful whether a referendum in Strasbourg would have ended in France's favour since the political parties striving for an autonomous Alsace or a connection to France accounted only for a small proportion of votes in the last Reichstag as well as in the local elections. The Alsatian autonomists who were pro French had won many votes in the more rural parts of the region and other towns since the annexation of the region by Germany in 1871.

        "As Western Europe witnessed the formation of new kingdoms, the Eastern Roman Empire remained intact and experienced an economic revival that lasted into the early 7th century. There were fewer invasions of the eastern section of the empire; most occurred in the Balkans. Peace with Persia, the traditional enemy of Rome, lasted throughout most of the 5th century. The Eastern Empire was marked by closer relations between the political state and Christian Church, with doctrinal matters assuming an importance in eastern politics that they did not have in Western Europe. Legal developments included the codification of Roman law; the first effort\u2014the Theodosian Code\u2014was completed in 438. Under Emperor Justinian (r. 527\u2013565), another compilation took place\u2014the Corpus Juris Civilis.

        "When Nintendo released the NES in the US, the design styling was deliberately different from that of other game consoles. Nintendo wanted to distinguish its product from those of competitors and to avoid the generally poor reputation that game consoles had acquired following the video game crash of 1983. One result of this philosophy was to disguise the cartridge slot design as a front-loading zero insertion force (ZIF) cartridge socket, designed to resemble the front-loading mechanism of a VCR. The newly designed connector worked quite well when both the connector and the cartridges were clean and the pins on the connector were new. Unfortunately, the ZIF connector was not truly zero insertion force. When a user inserted the cartridge into the NES, the force of pressing the cartridge down and into place bent the contact pins slightly, as well as pressing the cartridge\u2019s ROM board back into the cartridge itself. Frequent insertion and removal of cartridges caused the pins to wear out from repeated usage over the years and the ZIF",
        "Protestants also took the initiative in advocating for religious freedom. Freedom of conscience had high priority on the theological, philosophical, and political agendas since Luther refused to recant his beliefs before the Diet of the Holy Roman Empire at Worms (1521). In his view, faith was a free work of the Holy Spirit and could, therefore, not be forced on a person. The persecuted Anabaptists and Huguenots demanded freedom of conscience, and they practised separation of church and state. In the early seventeenth century, Baptists like John Smyth and Thomas Helwys published tracts in defense of religious freedom. Their thinking influenced John Milton and John Locke's stance on tolerance. Under the leadership of Baptist Roger Williams, Congregationalist Thomas Hooker, and Quaker William Penn, respectively, Rhode Island, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania combined democratic constitutions with freedom of religion. These colonies became safe havens for persecuted religious minorities, including Jews.

        "Birds have a very efficient system for diffusing oxygen into the blood; birds have a ten times greater surface area to gas exchange volume than mammals. As a result, birds have more blood in their capillaries per unit of volume of lung than a mammal. The arteries are composed of thick elastic muscles to withstand the pressure of the ventricular constriction, and become more rigid as they move away from the heart. Blood moves through the arteries, which undergo vasoconstriction, and into arterioles which act as a transportation system to distribute primarily oxygen as well as nutrients to all tissues of the body. As the arterioles move away from the heart and into individual organs and tissues they are further divided to increase surface area and slow blood flow. Travelling through the arterioles blood moves into the capillaries where gas exchange can occur. Capillaries are organized into capillary beds in tissues, it",

In the United States, much (though not all) of the former streetcar system in Washington, D.C.

They find that the figure of 85% is misleading because it implies that all human populations contain on average 85% of all genetic diversity. They claim that this does not correctly reflect human population history, because it treats all human groups as independent. A more realistic portrayal of the way human groups are related is to understand that some human groups are parental to other groups and that these groups represent paraphyletic groups to their descent groups. For example, under the recent African origin theory the human population in Africa is paraphyletic to all other human groups because it represents the ancestral group from which all non-African populations derive, but more than that, non-African groups only derive from a small non-representative sample of",

Gaddafi welcomed these reforms, calling for wide-scale privatization in a March 2003 speech. In 2003, the oil industry was largely sold to private corporations, and by 2004, there was $40 billion of direct foreign investment in Libya, a sixfold rise over 2003. Sectors of Libya's population reacted against these reforms with public demonstrations, and in March 2006, revolutionary hard-liners took control of the GPC cabinet; although scaling back the pace of the changes, they did not halt them.

In a notable letter to Marshal Soult detailing the plan for the campaign, Napoleon described the essential features of Napoleonic warfare and introduced the phrase le bataillon-carr\u00e9 ('square battalion'). In the bataillon-carr\u00e9 system, the various corps of the Grande Arm\u00e9e would march uniformly together in close supporting distance. If any single corps was attacked, the others could quickly spring into action and arrive to help. Napoleon invaded Prussia with 180,000 troops, rapidly marching on the right bank of the River Saale. As in previous campaigns, his fundamental objective was to destroy one opponent before reinforcements from another could tip the balance of the war. Upon learning the whereabouts of the Prussian army, the French swung westwards and crossed the Saale with overwhelming force. At the twin battles of Jena and Auerstedt, fought on 14 October, the French convincingly defeated",
        "Regarding the timing of German rapprochement, many historians agree that the dismissal of Maxim Litvinov, whose Jewish ethnicity was viewed unfavorably by Nazi Germany, removed an obstacle to negotiations with Germany. Stalin immediately directed Molotov to \"purge the ministry of Jews.\" Given Litvinov's prior attempts to create an anti-fascist coalition, association with the doctrine of collective security with France and Britain, and pro-Western orientation by the standards of the Kremlin, his dismissal indicated the existence of a Soviet option of rapprochement with Germany.[f] Likewise, Molotov's appointment served as a signal to Germany that the USSR was open to offers. The dismissal also signaled to France and Britain the existence of a potential negotiation option with Germany. One British official wrote that Litvinov's disappearance also meant the loss of an admirable technician or shock-absorber, while Molotov's \"modus operandi\" was \"more truly Bolshevik than diplomatic or cosmopolitan.\" Carr argued that the Soviet Union's replacement of Foreign",

According to critics, the Libyan people lived in a climate of fear under Gaddafi's administration, due to his government's pervasive surveillance of civilians. Gaddafi's Libya was typically described by western commentators as \"a police state\".

Predators may hunt actively for prey in pursuit predation, or sit and wait for prey to approach within striking distance, as in ambush predators. Some predators kill large prey and dismember or chew it prior to eating it, such as a jaguar or a human; others may eat their (usually much smaller) prey whole, as does a bottlenose dolphin swallowing a fish, or a snake, duck or stork swallowing a frog. Some animals that kill both large and small prey for their size (domestic cats and dogs are prime examples) may do either depending upon the circumstances; either would devour a large insect whole but dismember a rabbit. Some predation entails venom that subdues a prey creature before the predator ingests the prey by killing, which the",

Wang and Nyima argue that these were not diplomatic delegations at all, that Tibetan areas were ruled by the Ming since Tibetan leaders were granted positions as Ming officials, that horses were collected from Tibet as a mandatory \"corv\u00e9e\" tax, and therefore Tibetans were \"undertaking domestic affairs, not foreign diplomacy\". Sperling writes that the Ming simultaneously bought horses in the Kham region while fighting Tibetan tribes in Amdo and receiving Tibetan embassies in Nanjing.

Moulting is annual in most species, although some may have two moults a year, and large birds of prey may moult only once every few years. Moulting patterns vary across species. In passerines, flight feathers are replaced one at a time with the innermost primary being the first. When the fifth of sixth primary is replaced, the outermost tertiaries begin to drop. After the innermost tertiaries are moulted, the secondaries starting from the innermost begin to drop and this proceeds to the outer feathers (centrifugal moult). The greater primary coverts are moulted in synchrony with the primary that they overlap. A small number of species, such as",

Contrary to popular belief, there is no empirical evidence for a significant drop in self-esteem over the course of adolescence. \"Barometric self-esteem\" fluctuates rapidly and can cause severe distress and anxiety, but baseline self-esteem remains highly stable across adolescence.

        "Successful cultivation of cotton requires a long frost-free period, plenty of sunshine, and a moderate rainfall, usually from 600 to 1,200 mm (24 to 47 in). Soils usually need to be fairly heavy, although the level of nutrients does not need to be exceptional. In general, these conditions are met within the seasonally dry tropics and subtropics in the Northern and Southern hemispheres, but a large proportion of the cotton grown today is cultivated in areas with less rainfall that obtain the water from irrigation. Production of the crop for a given year usually starts soon after harvesting the preceding autumn. Cotton is naturally a perennial but is grown as an annual to help control pests. Planting time in spring in the Northern hemisphere varies from the beginning of February to the beginning of June. The area of the United States known as the South Plains",
        "The book was widely translated in Darwin's lifetime, but problems arose with translating concepts and metaphors, and some translations were biased by the translator's own agenda. Darwin distributed presentation copies in France and Germany, hoping that suitable applicants would come forward, as translators were expected to make their own arrangements with a local publisher. He welcomed the distinguished elderly naturalist and geologist Heinrich Georg Bronn, but the German translation published in 1860 imposed Bronn's own ideas, adding controversial themes that Darwin had deliberately omitted. Bronn translated \"favoured races\" as \"perfected races\", and added essays on issues including the origin of life, as well as a final chapter on religious implications partly inspired by Bronn's adherence to Naturphilosophie. In 1862, Bronn produced a second edition based on the third English edition and Darwin's suggested additions, but then died of a heart attack. Darwin corresponded closely with Julius Victor Carus, who published an improved translation in 1867. Darwin's",

In Scandinavia, with the help of his relative Earl H\u00e5kon Sigurdsson, ruler of Norway, Vladimir assembled a Viking army and reconquered Novgorod and Kiev from Yaropolk. As Prince of Kiev, Vladimir's most notable achievement was the Christianization of Kievan Rus', a process that began in 988.

It enclosed twenty pages describing an evolutionary mechanism, a response to Darwin's recent encouragement, with a request to send it on to Lyell if Darwin thought it worthwhile. The mechanism was similar to Darwin's own theory. Darwin wrote to Lyell that \"your words have come true with a vengeance, ... forestalled\" and he would \"of course, at once write and offer to send [it] to any journal\" that Wallace chose, adding that \"all my originality, whatever it may amount to, will be smashed\".

Iran became a major contributor to the Islamic Golden Age, producing many influential scientists, scholars, artists, and thinkers. Establishment of the Safavid Dynasty in 1501, converted the Iranian people from Sunni Islam to Twelver Shia Islam, and made Twelver Shia Islam the official religion of Iran. Safavid conversion of Iran from Sunnism to Shiism marked one of the most important turning points in Iranian and Muslim history. Starting in 1736 under Nader Shah, Iran reached its greatest territorial extent since the Sassanid Empire, briefly possessing what was arguably the most powerful empire at the time.

The relationship between the two models was murky; Gell-Mann referred to Feynman's partons derisively as \"put-ons\". In the mid-1960s, physicists believed that quarks were just a bookkeeping device for symmetry numbers, not real particles, as the statistics of the Omega-minus particle, if it were interpreted as three identical strange quarks bound together, seemed impossible if quarks were real.

After an 8-year separation, Deep Purple returned with the classic Machine Head line-up to produce Perfect Strangers (1984), which reached number five in the UK, hit the top five in five other countries, and was a platinum-seller in the US. After somewhat slower sales of its fourth album, Fair Warning, Van Halen rebounded with the Top 3 album Diver Down in 1982, then reached their commercial pinnacle with 1984. It reached number two on the Billboard album chart and provided the track \"Jump\", which reached number one on the singles chart and remained there for several weeks.

        "The United States has become essentially a two-party system. Since a conservative (such as the Republican Party) and liberal (such as the Democratic Party) party has usually been the status quo within American politics. The first parties were called Federalist and Republican, followed by a brief period of Republican dominance before a split occurred between National Republicans and Democratic Republicans. The former became the Whig Party and the latter became the Democratic Party. The Whigs survived only for two decades before they split over the spread of slavery, those opposed becoming members of the new Republican Party, as did anti-slavery members of the Democratic Party. Third parties (such as the Libertarian Party) often receive little support and are very rarely the victors in elections. Despite this, there have been several examples of third parties siphoning votes from major parties that were expected to win (such as Theodore Roosevelt in the election of 1912 and George Wallace in the election of 1968).",

The Irish left the Big East for the ACC during a prolonged period of instability in the Big East; while they maintain their football independence, they have committed to play five games per season against ACC opponents. In ice hockey, the Irish were forced to find a new conference home after the Big Ten Conference's decision to add the sport in 2013\u201314 led to a cascade of conference moves that culminated in the dissolution of the school's former hockey home, the Central Collegiate Hockey Association, after the 2012\u201313 season.

        "Adolescence marks a rapid change in one's role within a family. Young children tend to assert themselves forcefully, but are unable to demonstrate much influence over family decisions until early adolescence, when they are increasingly viewed by parents as equals. The adolescent faces the task of increasing independence while preserving a caring relationship with his or her parents. When children go through puberty, there is often a significant increase in parent\u2013child conflict and a less cohesive familial bond. Arguments often concern minor issues of control, such as curfew, acceptable clothing, and the adolescent's right to privacy, which adolescents may have previously viewed as issues over which their parents had complete authority. Parent-adolescent disagreement also increases as friends demonstrate a greater impact on one another, new influences on the adolescent that may be in opposition to parents' values. Social media has also played an increasing role in adolescent and parent disagreements. While parents never had to worry about the threats of social",

Peer groups offer members the opportunity to develop social skills such as empathy, sharing, and leadership. Adolescents choose peer groups based on characteristics similarly found in themselves. By utilizing these relationships, adolescents become more accepting of who they are becoming. Group norms and values are incorporated into an adolescent\u2019s own self-concept. Through developing new communication skills and reflecting upon those of their peers, as well as self-opinions and values, an adolescent can share and express emotions and other concerns without fear of rejection or judgment. Peer groups can have positive influences on an individual, such as on academic motivation and performance. However, while peers may facilitate social development for one another they may also hinder it. Peers can have negative influences, such as encouraging experimentation with drugs, drinking, vandalism, and stealing through peer pressure. Susceptibility to peer pressure increases during early adolescence, peaks around age 14, and declines thereafter. Further evidence of peers",

Although hymnographers and scholars, like the Emperor Justinian I, were accustomed to call Mary \"prepurified\" in their poetic and credal statements, the first point of departure for more fully commenting on Nazianzen's meaning occurs in Sophronius of Jerusalem. In other places Sophronius explains that the Theotokos was already immaculate, when she was \"purified\" at the Annunciation and goes so far as to note that John the Baptist is literally \"holier than all 'Men' born of woman\" since Mary's surpassing holiness signifies that she was holier than even John after his sanctification in utero. Sophronius' teaching is augmented and incorporated by St. John Damascene (d. 749/750). John, besides many passages wherein he extolls the Theotokos for her purification at the Annunciation, grants her the unique honor of \"purifying the waters of baptism by touching them.\" This",

As a result, Zhejiang has made itself one of the richest provinces, and the \"Zhejiang spirit\" has become something of a legend within China.

Beginning with St. Gregory Nazianzen, his explanation of the \"purification\" of Jesus and Mary at the circumcision (Luke 2:22) prompted him to consider the primary meaning of \"purification\" in Christology (and by extension in Mariology) to refer to a perfectly sinless nature that manifested itself in glory in a moment of grace (e.g., Jesus at his Baptism). St. Gregory Nazianzen designated Mary as \"prokathartheisa (prepurified).\" Gregory likely attempted to solve the riddle of the Purification of Jesus and Mary in the Temple through considering the human natures of Jesus and Mary as equally holy and therefore both purified in this manner of grace and glory. Gregory's doctrines surrounding Mary's purification were likely related to the burgeoning commemoration of the Mother of God in and around Constantinople very close to the date of Christmas.

It has been recently found that demographic patterns suggest that the transition to adulthood is now occurring over a longer span of years than was the case during the middle of the 20th century. Accordingly, youth, a period that spans late adolescence and early adulthood, has become a more prominent stage of the life course. This therefore has caused various factors to become important during this development. So many factors contribute to the developing social identity of an adolescent from commitment, to coping devices, to social media. All of these factors are affected by the environment an adolescent grows up in. A child from a more privileged upbringing is exposed to more opportunities and better situations in general.",
        "The landscapes of Thuringia are quite diverse. The far north is occupied by the Harz mountains, followed by the Goldene Aue, a fertile floodplain around Nordhausen with the Helme as most important river. The north-west includes the Eichsfeld, a hilly and sometimes forested region, where the Leine river emanates. The central and northern part of Thuringia is defined by the 3000 km\u00b2 wide Thuringian Basin, a very fertile and flat area around the Unstrut river and completely surrounded by the following hill chains (clockwise from the north-west): D\u00fcn, Hainleite, Windleite, Kyffh\u00e4user, Hohe Schrecke, Schm\u00fccke, Finne, Ettersberg, Steigerwald, Thuringian Forest, H\u00f6rselberge and Hainich. Within the Basin the smaller hill chains Fahner H\u00f6he and Heilinger H\u00f6hen.

        "The relationships adolescents have with their peers, family, and members of their social sphere play a vital role in the social development of an adolescent. As an adolescent's social sphere develops rapidly as they distinguish the differences between friends and acquaintances, they often become heavily emotionally invested in friends. This is not harmful; however, if these friends expose an individual to potentially harmful situations, this is an aspect of peer pressure. Adolescence is a critical period in social development because adolescents can be easily influenced by the people they develop close relationships with. This is the first time individuals can truly make their own decisions, which also makes this a sensitive period. Relationships are vital in the social development of an adolescent due to the extreme influence peers can have over an individual. These relationships become significant because they begin to help the adolescent understand the concept",

        "Some rock musicians today use mandolins, often single-stringed electric models rather than double-stringed acoustic mandolins. One example is Tim Brennan of the Irish-American punk rock band Dropkick Murphys. In addition to electric guitar, bass, and drums, the band uses several instruments associated with traditional Celtic music, including mandolin, tin whistle, and Great Highland bagpipes. The band explains that these instruments accentuate the growling sound they favor. The 1991 R.E.M. hit \"Losing My Religion\" was driven by a few simple mandolin licks played by guitarist Peter Buck, who also played the mandolin in nearly a dozen other songs. The single peaked at No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart (#1 on the rock and alternative charts), Luther Dickinson of North Mississippi Allstars and The Black Crowes has made frequent use of the mandolin, most notably on",
        "Predators are often another organism's prey, and likewise prey are often predators. Though blue jays prey on insects, they may in turn be prey for cats and snakes, and snakes may be the prey of hawks. One way of classifying predators is by trophic level. Organisms that feed on autotrophs, the producers of the trophic pyramid, are known as herbivores or primary consumers; those that feed on heterotrophs such as animals are known as secondary consumers. Secondary consumers are a type of carnivore, but there are also tertiary consumers eating these carnivores, quartary consumers eating them, and so forth. Because only a fraction of energy is passed on to the next level, this hierarchy of predation must end somewhere, and very seldom goes higher than five or six levels, and may go only as high as three trophic levels (for example, a lion that preys upon large herbivores such as wildebeest, which",

Al-Husayn sent his cousin Muslim bin Agail to verify if they would rally behind him. When the news reached Yazid I, he sent Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad, ruler of Basrah, with the instruction to prevent the people of Kufa rallying behind Al-Husayn. Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad managed to disperse the crowd that gathered around Muslim bin Agail and captured him. Realizing Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad had been instructed to prevent Husayn from establishing support in Kufa, Muslim bin Agail requested a message to be sent to Husayn to prevent his immigration to Kufa.

General De Wimpffen, the commander of the French V Corps in reserve, hoped to launch a combined infantry and cavalry attack against the Prussian XI Corps. But by 11:00, Prussian artillery took a toll on the French while more Prussian troops arrived on the battlefield. The French cavalry, commanded by General Marguerite, launched three desperate attacks on the nearby village of Floing where the Prussian XI Corps was concentrated.

        "Similar to reptiles, birds are predominantly uricotelic, with their kidneys removing nitrogenous waste from their bloodstream and excreting it as uric acid rather than urea or ammonia through the ureters into the intestine. Unlike mammals, birds lack a urinary bladder and external urethral opening, and with the exception of ostriches, they eliminate uric acid mixed with feces as a semisolid waste. However, certain birds, such as hummingbirds, can exhibit facultative ammonotelism, expelling most nitrogenous waste as ammonia. Additionally, birds excrete creatine rather than creatinine, a process that involves the cloaca, a multi-purpose opening that serves as a conduit for waste elimination, mating, and egg-laying. Furthermore, many bird species regurgitate pellets, and within the Palaeognathae and Anseriformes groups, males (excluding kiwis), the cloaca plays a crucial role in their reproductive processes.",
        "Mammalian hair, or pelage, exhibits a remarkable range of color variations across populations, individuals within a population, and even within an individual organism. A common phenomenon in mammalian taxa is the light-dark color variation, which can be attributed to various factors. While age-related changes may contribute to color variation in some cases, other factors are often at play. Ecological interactions with other populations or environmental conditions exert selective pressures, favoring certain colors that enhance survival. The most significant driver of color variation is thought to be camouflage, which has been shaped by natural selection. However, other factors, such as sexual selection, communication, and physiological processes, also influence the evolution of coloration in mammals. Camouflage emerges as the primary mechanism underlying color variation, although other factors may also be involved.",
        "In Israel, education holds a revered place in the national culture, with its significance rooted in ancient Israelite tradition. The pursuit of higher education is widely regarded as a crucial stepping stone to upward social mobility and a higher socioeconomic status within Israeli society. This emphasis on education can be traced back to the Renaissance and Enlightenment Movement, as well as the roots of Zionism in the 1880s. In the Levant, Jewish communities were the first to introduce compulsory education, with the organized community taking responsibility for the education of future generations alongside parents. The strong cultural emphasis on scholarship, learning, and intellectual pursuits, as well as Israel's high university educational attainment rate, illustrate the country's deep value for higher education. As a result, the Israeli education system has received widespread praise.",

        "In the aftermath of the Wu Hu uprising and the Jin dynasty's collapse, many high-ranking Chinese families had formed alliances with non-Chinese rulers and military conquerors in the north. As a result, some may have forfeited their social status and fled to areas south of the Yangtze River, including regions near Hangzhou. It is possible that Chinese refugees from north China settled in the vicinity, with one notable example being the clan of Zhuge Liang, a prominent chancellor of Shu Han during the Three Kingdoms era. This family, originally from the Central Plain, established a self-contained village called Zhuge Village (Zhege Cun) on the outskirts of Hangzhou, comprising exclusively individuals bearing the surname Zhuge. For centuries, the village has maintained its isolation from the surrounding communities, only recently gaining public recognition. This suggests that a small number of influential Chinese refugees from the Central Plain may have sought refuge in the region, including potentially near Hangzhou.",
        "The 1998 season commenced on a poignant note with the passing of legendary broadcaster Harry Caray. Following the retirement of Sandberg and the trade of Dunston, the Cubs had vacancies to fill. The signing of Henry Rodr\u00edguez, affectionately known as \"H-Rod,\" bolstered the lineup as the cleanup hitter, providing protection for Sammy Sosa. Rodr\u00edguez had a remarkable first season in Chicago, slugging 31 home runs. Kevin Tapani led the team with a career-high 19 wins, Rod Beck anchored the strong bullpen, and Mark Grace turned in one of his finest seasons. The Cubs received immense media attention in 1998, with Sosa and rookie phenom Kerry Wood being the team's biggest attractions. Wood's remarkable performance included a one-hitter against the Houston Astros, in which he tied the major league record of 20 strikeouts in nine innings. His impressive strikeout numbers earned him the nickname \"Kid K\" and ultimately the 1998 NL Rookie of the Year award. Sosa's June performance was remarkable, as he hit a major league record 20 home runs in the month.",

Although some of these risks, such as emotional turmoil due to fear of abuse or exploitation, and sexually transmitted infections and diseases, including HIV/AIDS, are not exclusive to adolescence, others like teenage pregnancy, which can result from inadequate or failed use of contraception, are viewed as social issues in most Western cultures. It's worth noting that one in four sexually active teenagers is likely to contract an STI. In the United States, many adolescents opt for alternative forms of sexual activity, mistakenly believing this reduces the risk of STIs.

        "Throughout the history of the South Slavs, various regional and ethnic languages, such as Chakavian, Kajkavian, and Shtokavian, evolved and diverged independently. Before the 19th century, these languages were collectively referred to as \"Illyric\", \"Slavic\", \"Slavonian\", \"Bosnian\", \"Dalmatian\", \"Serbian\", or \"Croatian\". The term \"Serbo-Croatian\" was first coined by Jacob Grimm in 1824 and later popularized by Jernej Kopitar, a Vienna philologist, and accepted by Croatian grammarians in 1854 and 1859. At that time, the territories of Serbs and Croats were still under Ottoman and Austrian rule. Officially, the language was known as \"Serbo-Croat\", \"Croato-Serbian\", \"Serbian and Croatian\", \"Croatian and Serbian\", \"Serbian or Croatian\", or \"Croatian or Serbian\". In informal settings, however, both Serbs and Croats often referred to the language as \"Serbian\" or \"Croatian\", without implying a distinction between the two, and in independent Bosnia and Herzegovina, the terms \"Bosnian\", \"Croatian\", and \"Serbian\" were generally considered to be interchangeable names for a single language.",
        "The adolescent life cycle is marked by a crucial stage of identity development. For many, this process begins during the adolescent years, a time when individuals are more inclined to experiment with various behaviors and appearances in a quest to uncover their true selves. In essence, adolescents embark on a journey of exploring multiple identities to determine which one best aligns with their sense of self. However, this journey is often complicated by various factors, including family dynamics, environmental influences, and social standing. Research has shown that this process is more accurately characterized as identity development, rather than formation, and suggests that it is a normative and dynamic transformation, with both content and structure evolving over time.",

The Greek population that dominated the urban centers was bolstered by immigration from Greece. Notable among these cities were newly established colonies such as Antioch, the cities of the Syrian tetrapolis, Seleucia, situated north of Babylon, and Dura-Europos on the Euphrates. These cities maintained traditional Greek city-state institutions, including assemblies, councils, and elected magistrates, although this was merely a facade, as the royal Seleucid officials remained in control. Beyond these cities, the Seleucids established numerous garrisons (choria), military colonies (katoikiai), and Greek villages (komai) throughout the empire to solidify their authority. This \"Greco-Macedonian\" population, which also",

One notable area of application is in occupational settings, where identity construction plays a crucial role. However, this can become particularly complex in jobs that are stigmatized or considered \"dirty work\" (Hughes, 1951). According to Tracy and Trethewey (2005), individuals are drawn to or repelled by certain jobs based on how well they align with their desired professional identity. Some occupations carry distinct social connotations, such as prestige or stigma. For instance, Tracy highlights the example of correctional officers struggling to overcome the perception of their role as \"glorified maids\" (Tracy & Tretheway, 2005). This process of justifying and valuing occupational choices is also linked to factors like workplace satisfaction and overall well-being (Tracy & Scott, 2006, p. 33).",
        "Emotions play a significant role in fostering social interactions and relationships, ultimately linking to fundamental physiological processes, particularly the stress response. This connection is crucial, as emotions are intricately tied to the anti-stress complex, which includes the oxytocin-attachment system, responsible for facilitating bonding. Research suggests that emotional temperament has a profound impact on social connectedness and fitness in complex social systems, as observed by Kurt Kortschal in 2013. Interestingly, these characteristics are not unique to humans, as they are also shared with other species and taxa, and are the result of genetic influences and continuous transmission. The genetic code embedded in DNA sequences serves as the blueprint for assembling proteins that comprise our cells, with zygotes relying on inherited genetic information from their parental germ cells. Furthermore, at every speciation event, heritable traits that enabled its ancestors to thrive are passed down.",
        "Building upon the pioneering work of Spanish physician Gregorio Mara\u00f1\u00f3n, Stanley Schachter developed his theory. Mara\u00f1\u00f3n had conducted an innovative experiment, injecting patients with epinephrine and then inquiring about their feelings. He discovered that while the patients did experience something, they were unable to identify their physiological arousal as an emotion in the absence of a corresponding stimulus. Schachter concurred that physiological responses significantly influence emotions. He proposed that these responses facilitate a concentrated cognitive evaluation of a stimulus that triggers physiological arousal, and it is this appraisal that defines the subjective emotional experience. According to Schachter's theory, emotions arise from a two-stage process: general physiological arousal and the subsequent emotional experience. For instance, the physiological response of a racing heart, triggered by the sight of a bear in the kitchen, would be the initial stage, followed by a cognitive appraisal that shapes the subjective emotional experience.",
        "The political unrest persisted. John started to explore the possibility of forming an alliance with King Philip II of France, who had recently returned from the crusade. His goal was to secure Normandy, Anjou, and other territories in France that belonged to Richard in exchange for supporting Philip. However, John's mother intervened and dissuaded him from pursuing this alliance. Meanwhile, Longchamp, who had left England after Walter's intervention, returned and claimed that he had been unfairly removed as justiciar. John resolved the issue by suppressing Longchamp's claims, in exchange for promises of support from the royal administration, including a reaffirmation of his position as the rightful heir to the throne. When Richard failed to return from the crusade, John began to assert that his brother was either deceased or permanently lost. In reality, Richard had been captured by the Duke of Austria en route to England and was being held for ransom by Emperor Henry VI. Seizing the opportunity, John took action.",
        "During the early modern period, universities built upon the academic traditions established during the Middle Ages, encompassing subjects such as natural philosophy, logic, medicine, theology, mathematics, astronomy (including astrology), law, grammar, and rhetoric. Aristotle's influence was widespread throughout the curriculum, while medical studies drew heavily from Galen and Arabic scholarship. The impact of humanism on this academic landscape cannot be overstated. Once humanist scholars joined university faculties, they revolutionized the study of grammar and rhetoric through the studia humanitatis. Humanist professors emphasized the development of students' writing, speaking, and translation skills, as well as their ability to interpret classical texts and live virtuous lives. This humanist approach to learning had a ripple effect, influencing other scholars within the university, who were drawn to the linguistic expertise and ideological emphasis on ancient texts. Notably, humanist perspectives were adopted by medical professors such as Niccol\u00f2 Leoniceno, Thomas Linacre, and William Cop, who incorporated these approaches into their teaching and research.",
        "Throughout the 1860s, Democratic Party candidates dominated local elections in the city, strengthening its connection to the South and the ruling party. In 1861, Mayor Fernando Wood proposed that the city declare independence from Albany and the United States after the South seceded, though this idea was ultimately shelved. Tensions ran high during the American Civil War (1861-1865) due to the introduction of military conscription laws, which exempted wealthy individuals who could pay a $300 commutation fee to hire a substitute. This policy sparked the 1863 Draft Riots, in which predominantly ethnic Irish working-class individuals took to the streets. Initially, their anger was directed towards the city's elite, before turning to attacks on black New Yorkers and their properties. The competition between Irish immigrants and African Americans for jobs had been fierce for over a decade, exacerbating the tensions. During the riots, rioters set fire to the Colored Orphan Asylum, but thanks to the efforts of numerous individuals, over 200 children managed to escape harm.",
        "During the French Enlightenment in the mid-18th century, the term \"humanism\" began to be used in a more ideological sense. In 1765, an anonymous article in a French periodical introduced the concept of \"general love of humanity\" as a previously unnamed virtue, which they dubbed \"humanism\" due to its beauty and necessity. This period saw the emergence of various grassroots organizations, such as philanthropic and benevolent societies, focused on improving human conditions and disseminating knowledge (some with Christian roots, others not). Following the French Revolution, the notion that human virtue could be created solely through reason, unaided by traditional religious institutions, became a contentious issue, attributed by opponents of the Revolution to philosophers like Rousseau, who were seen as key figures of the Enlightenment.",

Notably, many of these levies were collected in the absence of actual military campaigns, deviating from the original purpose of scutage as an alternative to military service. John exploited his authority to demand relief payments when estates and castles changed hands, often extracting enormous sums that exceeded the financial capabilities of the barons. Building on the success of his predecessor's sheriff appointment sales, John initiated a new round of appointments, with the new incumbents recouping their investment through increased fines and penalties, particularly in the forests. John also expanded the practice of charging higher fees to widows seeking to remain single, an innovation introduced by Richard. Furthermore, John continued to issue charters for new towns,",
        "During the Enlightenment, several novel ideas about religion emerged, including Deism and discussions of atheism. According to Thomas Paine, Deism is a straightforward belief in God as the Creator, untethered from biblical or miraculous sources. Instead, Deists relied solely on personal reason to guide their faith, a perspective that resonated with many thinkers of the time. While atheism was a topic of conversation, few proponents existed. As noted by Wilson and Reill, even critics of Christianity during this era were more likely to subscribe to skepticism, Deism, vitalism, or pantheism rather than true atheism. Some, like Pierre Bayle, argued that atheists could indeed be moral individuals. However, others, such as Voltaire, believed that a lack of faith in a supreme authority who punishes evil would undermine the moral order of society. In their view, without a fear of consequences, individuals would have no reason to obey the law or adhere to a higher power.",
        "While awake, sleep does not impact memory acquisition or recall. Instead, sleep plays a crucial role in memory consolidation, strengthening neural connections in the brain. This process enhances the brain's ability to stabilize and retain memories, as evidenced by numerous studies demonstrating improved memory retention through active consolidation. During slow-wave sleep (SWS), system consolidation takes place, where memories are reactivated and undergo qualitative changes as they are transferred to long-term storage. During sleep, the hippocampus replays daily events for the neocortex, which reviews and processes memories, moving them into long-term memory. Conversely, inadequate sleep hinders learning, as weakened neural connections impede the retention of new information, resulting in reduced cognitive abilities.",
        "Contrary to the common notion that memory functions like a recording device, it is a dynamic process involving distinct phases that span from seconds to a lifetime. Research has shown that memories are not fixed entities but rather constructed during the encoding and retrieval processes. Individuals have the ability to shape their memories through their interactions with them. For instance, a landmark study by Elizabeth Loftus and John Palmer (1974) demonstrated this concept. Participants were shown a film of a traffic accident and then asked different questions about what they had witnessed. Interestingly, those asked \"How fast were the cars going when they smashed into each other?\" reported higher speeds than those asked \"How fast were the cars going when they hit each other?\" Additionally, when questioned a week later about the presence of broken glass in the film, individuals who had been asked the \"smashed\" question were more likely to recall seeing it, with the likelihood doubling compared to those who had been asked the alternative question.",
        "The region of modern Zhejiang was not under the significant influence of the Shang civilization during the second millennium BC. Instead, it was inhabited by various groups known as the Hundred Yue, including the Dongyue and the Ouyue. Records from the Spring and Autumn Period mention the emergence of the kingdom of Yue. According to historical accounts, the kingdom was situated in northern Zhejiang, with its leaders claiming descent from Yu the Great, the founder of the Shang dynasty. Archaeological evidence suggests that the Baiyue and the kingdom of Yue developed their own distinct culture and history, which differed from those of kingdoms in northern and central China, whose cultures and histories were meticulously documented during the Spring and Autumn Period and into the Qin dynasty. The \"Song of the Yue Boatman\", a famous Chinese ballad, provides a glimpse into the unique cultural heritage of the region.",
        "Protestantism's spread from Germany into France led to the nickname \"Huguenots\" for French Protestants. Calvin remained invested in French religious affairs from his Geneva base, training pastors to lead congregations there. Despite fierce persecution, the Reformed tradition continued to gain traction across France, resonating with those disillusioned with the Catholic establishment's rigidity and complacency. As French Protestantism took on a distinct political dimension, particularly with the conversions of nobles in the 1550s, it laid the groundwork for a series of conflicts known as the French Wars of Religion. The civil wars intensified with the sudden death of Henry II of France in 1559, marked by atrocities and outrage, exemplified most brutally in the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre of August 1572, where the Roman Catholic party slaughtered between 30,000 and 100,000 Huguenots across France. The wars continued.",
        "The National Football League's preseason stands out from other team sports due to its highly structured format. Each NFL team plays four exhibition games annually, with two home and two away matches, with the exception of two teams that participate in the Pro Football Hall of Fame Game, which is the fifth and final preseason game. These exhibition matches, typically held in August, serve the purpose of allowing coaches to refine their roster from the initial 90-man offseason list to the regular-season limit of 53 players. Although the scheduling formula for preseason games is less rigid than for regular season games, there are several restrictions and traditions that influence the selection of preseason opponents. Additionally, teams are limited in the days and times they can schedule these games. A unique practice in the NFL is the absence of split-squad games, where a team would typically divide into two squads to play multiple games on the same day, unlike in baseball and hockey.",
        "Libya faced economic hardships in the early to mid-1980s, with its annual oil revenues plummeting from $21 billion in 1982 to $5.4 billion by 1986. During this period, the country focused on developing irrigation projects, particularly the ambitious Great Man-Made River project, often referred to as \"Gaddafi's Pet Project\". Although the project was initially expected to be completed by the end of the decade, it remained unfinished at the dawn of the 21st century. In response to the economic crisis, Libya increased its military spending while cutting back on other administrative budgets. The country had a long history of supporting the FROLINAT militia in neighboring Chad and re-invaded the country in December 1980 at the request of the Frolinat-controlled GUNT government to aid in the civil war. In January 1981, Gaddafi proposed a political merger between Libya and Chad, but the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) rejected the idea and demanded a Libyan withdrawal, which occurred in November 1981. The civil war resumed, prompting Libya to send its troops back into Chad, where they clashed with French forces supporting the southern Chadian forces.",
        "South Korea played host to a tumultuous torch relay event on April 27, held in Seoul, which had previously hosted the 1988 Summer Olympics. The planned torchbearers, Choi Seung-kook and Park Won-sun, declined to participate in protest of the Chinese government's actions in Tibet. To maintain security, over 8,000 riot police were deployed along the 24-kilometre route, which started at Olympic Park, a venue built during the 1988 Summer Games. Clashes erupted between Chinese students and protesters on the day of the relay, with rocks, bottles, and punches being thrown. In a dramatic incident, a North Korean defector attempted to self-immolate in protest of China's treatment of North Korean refugees. He poured gasoline on himself, but police swiftly intervened, surrounding him and carrying him away to safety. Two other demonstrators attempted to disrupt the torch relay but were unsuccessful. Initial disturbances occurred near the beginning of the relay between a group of approximately 500 Chinese supporters and a counter-protesting crowd, leading to a tense and chaotic atmosphere.",
        "The concepts of separation of church and state held by Thomas Jefferson and James Madison have been the subject of prolonged debate. As President, Jefferson refused to issue Thanksgiving proclamations sent to him by Congress, although he did issue a Thanksgiving and Prayer proclamation as Governor of Virginia. Madison, on the other hand, issued four religious proclamations while in office, but vetoed two bills on the grounds that they contravened the First Amendment. Interestingly, both Jefferson and Madison attended religious services at the Capitol. Prior to the Constitution's ratification, Madison argued that \"if religion is exempt from the authority of society as a whole, it is even less subject to that of the legislative body.\" After leaving office, Madison emphasized the importance of \"total separation of church and state.\" In his writings, he emphasized that the Constitution ensures a strong \"practical distinction between religion and civil government,\" underscoring the need for a clear separation between the two.",
        "The publications of Virgil's works had a profound impact on Latin poetry, transforming it almost immediately. His Eclogues, Georgics, and especially the Aeneid became essential reading for educated Romans, who were familiar with these texts from their school days. The influence of Virgil's poetry can be seen in the works of subsequent poets, who often drew upon his works to create meaning in their own poetry. Ovid's Amores 1.1.1-2, for instance, parodies the opening lines of the Aeneid, while Book 14 of his Metamorphoses, known as the \"mini-Aeneid,\" is a notable example of how poets responded to Virgil's epic genre. In contrast, Lucan's Bellum Civile is often regarded as an anti-Virgilian epic, departing significantly from traditional Virgilian practices by dispensing with divine intervention and focusing on historical events. The Flavian poet Statius, in his 12-book epic Thebaid, engages closely with Virgil's poetry, even cautioning his own work not to rival the Aeneid but rather follow in its footsteps with reverence. Similarly, Silius Italicus's poetry also demonstrates the enduring influence of Virgil's works.",
        "According to Terry Eastland, author of \"From Ending Affirmative Action: The Case for Colorblind Justice\", the primary arguments in favor of affirmative action can be categorized into two main points: addressing past discrimination and promoting diversity. Eastland contends that the founders of affirmative action did not foresee how its benefits would primarily accrue to middle-class minorities who do not necessarily need them. Furthermore, she argues that affirmative action is often accompanied by a stigma that can instill feelings of self-doubt and entitlement among minority individuals. Eastland believes that affirmative action poses a significant risk that rarely yields significant results, and that its absence would allow for more free competition among individuals. Similarly, libertarian economist Thomas Sowell, in his book \"Affirmative Action Around the World: An Empirical Study\", highlights the negative consequences of affirmative action. Sowell notes that such policies encourage non-preferred groups to identify as members of preferred groups, effectively manipulating the system to their advantage.",
        "During this era, the United States' most significant military engagement was the War of 1812. As Britain was heavily involved in a major conflict with Napoleon's France, it adopted a policy of blocking American shipments to France. The United States aimed to maintain neutrality while pursuing international trade. However, Britain severed trade ties and forcibly conscripted American sailors into the Royal Navy, despite repeated protests. Additionally, Britain supported an Indian uprising in the American Midwest, with the objective of establishing an Indian state that would hinder American expansion. Frustrated by these actions, the United States declared war on the United Kingdom in 1812, marking the first official declaration of war by the U.S. With limited prospects of defeating the Royal Navy, the U.S. launched a campaign by invading British Canada, hoping to utilize captured territory as leverage. The invasion of Canada was a disaster, while concurrent wars with Native Americans on the western front, including Tecumseh's War and the Creek War, proved more successful. Following Napoleon's defeat in 1814, Britain dispatched large veteran armies to invade the United States.",
        "The Qing dynasty maintained its imperial grip on the outer regions, with the emperor assuming the role of Mongol khan, patron of Tibetan Buddhism, and protector of Muslims. However, this policy shifted with the establishment of Xinjiang province in 1884. During the Great Game era, Yaqub Beg, backed by the British Empire, seized power in Xinjiang from Central Asia following the Dungan revolt in northwest China, declaring himself the ruler of Kashgaria. In response, the Qing court dispatched forces to defeat Yaqub Beg, and Xinjiang was subsequently reconquered. The Qing then imposed its political system on the region, mirroring that of China proper. The Kumul Khanate, which had been incorporated into the Qing empire as a vassal after helping the Qing defeat the Zunghars in 1757, retained its status throughout the dynasty's duration, up until the Xinhai Revolution of 1930. In the early 20th century, Britain launched an expedition into Tibet, compelling the Tibetans to accept British dominance.",
        "Brigham Young University (BYU) boasts a remarkable 21 NCAA varsity teams, with 19 of them previously competing in the Mountain West Conference from its inception in 1999 to 2011. Prior to this, the teams participated in the Western Athletic Conference. Each team is proudly known as the \"Cougars,\" accompanied by the iconic mascot Cosmo the Cougar, who has been a beloved symbol since 1953. The school's fight song, the Cougar Fight Song, resonates throughout campus. Notably, BYU athletes tend to be older on average due to many students serving full-time missions for two years \u2013 typically men at 18 and women at 19. The NCAA permits students to fulfill their missions without deducting the time from their eligibility period. Although this has sparked some minor debate, it is generally acknowledged that this doesn't grant the school a significant advantage, as athletes receive limited athletic and physical training during their missions. Additionally, BYU has garnered attention from sports networks for its stance on refusing to play games on certain dates.",
        "John treated the interdict as a papal declaration of war, prompting him to take drastic measures against Innocent personally and to drive a wedge between English clergy who sympathized with him and those who were firmly allied with Rome. To achieve this, John seized the lands of recalcitrant clergy, as well as those belonging to Innocent himself, and arrested the concubines of many clerics, only releasing them after fines were paid. He also confiscated the properties of church members who had fled England and offered protection to those who remained loyal to him. In some cases, individual institutions were able to negotiate terms for managing their own estates and keeping their produce. However, by 1209, the situation remained unresolved, and Innocent threatened to excommunicate John if he didn't agree to Langton's appointment. When this ultimatum failed, Innocent continued to exert pressure.",
        "In mainland China, the Japanese 3rd, 6th, and 40th Divisions converged at Yueyang and launched a three-pronged assault, crossing the Xinqiang River before attempting to breach the Miluo River and reach Changsha. This strategic push was foiled by Chinese forces, who secured a significant victory in Changsha in January 1942, marking the first major Allied triumph against Japan. Following the Doolittle Raid, the Japanese army embarked on a vast sweep through Zhejiang and Jiangxi provinces, seeking to eliminate American airmen who had survived the raid, punish Chinese civilians who had aided them, and destroy airbases. This operation, known as the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Campaign, began on May 15, 1942, with a force comprising 40 infantry battalions and 15-16 artillery battalions. However, the Chinese forces effectively repelled the Japanese invasion by September. The campaign left a trail of destruction in its wake, with the Imperial Japanese Army inflicting widespread devastation on the region.",
        "CNET, a prominent tech media outlet, bestowed the new Super Slim PlayStation 3 with an impressive 4 out of 5 stars, deeming it \"Excellent\". The reviewer praised the console's ability to condense a powerful gaming machine into an even smaller package while retaining the same features as its predecessors, including a vast gaming library and robust streaming services. However, the critic also expressed disappointment with the \"budget\" design and disc-loader, noting that the cover sometimes fails to catch, leaving the user with a \"cheap\" and inconvenient experience reminiscent of old credit card imprinter machines. Furthermore, the reviewer was critical of the price point, pointing out that the cheapest Super Slim model was still pricier than the cheapest Slim model, and that the smaller size and larger hard drive did not constitute an upgrade, given that the hard drive on a Slim model is easily removable and replaceable.",
        "In July 1645, Dorgon issued a contentious edict, known as the \"haircutting order\", which compelled adult Han Chinese men to shave the front of their heads and style the remaining hair into the queue, a hairstyle typically worn by Manchu men, on pain of death. The edict's warning was stark: \"To keep your hair, you risk your life; To keep your life, you cut your hair.\" To the Manchus, this decree was a litmus test of loyalty and a means to distinguish friend from foe. For the Han Chinese, however, it represented a humiliating concession to Qing authority, which clashed with traditional Confucian values. The Classic of Filial Piety, a revered text, emphasized that \"a person's body and hair, being gifts from their parents, should not be harmed.\" Prior to the Qing dynasty, adult men did not cut their hair under the Ming regime, instead opting to wear their locks unaltered.",
        "The notion of boundaries can be interpreted as either inclusive or exclusive, depending on how others perceive them. Exclusive boundaries emerge when an individual adopts a marker that restricts the behavior of others, whereas inclusive boundaries are created when a marker is used that others are willing and able to associate with. Interestingly, inclusive boundaries can also impose limitations on the individuals they include, by defining the extent of their inclusion within other boundaries. A pertinent example is the use of a specific language by a newcomer in a room where multiple languages are spoken. While some people may comprehend the language used by the newcomer, others may not. Those who don't understand it might view it as a neutral identifier, but others might perceive it as an exclusive boundary meant to distinguish the newcomer from them.",
        "During the 78 rpm era, various manufacturers experimented with innovative record materials, introducing flexible or supposedly \"unbreakable\" records. In the UK, Nicole records, composed of celluloid or a similar substance coated onto a cardboard core, were produced from 1904, but they suffered from excessive surface noise. In the United States, Columbia Records launched the \"Marconi Velvet Tone Record\" in 1907, featuring fiber-cored pressings with relatively quiet surfaces. However, their longevity and performance relied on the use of specialized gold-plated Marconi Needles, which limited their success. Around 1930, thin, flexible plastic records like the German Phonycord, British Filmophone, and Goodson records emerged, but they also failed to gain traction. Meanwhile, French Path\u00e9 Cellodiscs, made of a thin, black plastic, which bears an uncanny resemblance to the material used in some modern records, were also produced during this time.",
        "In 1919, following the Treaty of Versailles, Strasbourg was returned to France in accordance with US President Woodrow Wilson's \"Fourteen Points,\" without the requirement of a local referendum. The effective date of the handover was later designated as Armistice Day. It is uncertain whether a referendum in Strasbourg would have yielded a French victory, given that parties advocating for autonomous Alsace or reunification with France held only a limited number of votes in the last German Reichstag and local elections. Pro-French Alsatian autonomists had garnered significant support in rural areas and other towns since Germany annexed Alsace in 1871. The movement began with the first Reichstag election, resulting in the election of \"protestatory deputies,\" who remained the sole Alsatian representatives in the German parliament until Bismarck's downfall in 1890.",
        "During the formation of new kingdoms in Western Europe, the Eastern Roman Empire maintained its integrity and experienced a prolonged economic resurgence, which persisted until the early 7th century. The eastern sector of the empire faced fewer invasions, mostly limited to the Balkans. The Eastern Roman Empire enjoyed a lasting peace with Persia, its long-standing rival, throughout most of the 5th century. Characterized by a closer relationship between the state and the Christian Church, the Eastern Empire placed significant emphasis on theological matters, which was not the case in Western Europe. The Roman legal system underwent significant developments, marked by the codification of Roman law, with the Theodosian Code being completed in 438. Later, Emperor Justinian (527-565) oversaw the compilation of the Corpus Juris Civilis. Additionally, he directed the construction of the Hagia Sophia in Constantinople and the reconquest of North Africa from the Vandals and Italy from the Ostrogoths under the leadership of Belisarius (d. 565). Although the conquest of Italy was not fully completed, a devastating outbreak of plague in 542 led to the remainder of Justinian's reign focusing on defensive measures.",
        "Upon the release of the NES in the US, Nintendo deliberately deviated from the design norms of other game consoles to distinguish its product and distance itself from the poor reputation of the industry following the 1983 video game crash. This approach led to the development of a unique cartridge slot design, camouflaged as a front-loading zero insertion force (ZIF) cartridge socket, mimicking the mechanism of a VCR. Initially, this design worked seamlessly when the connector and cartridges were clean and the pins were new. However, the ZIF connector had a critical flaw - it was not truly zero insertion force. As users inserted the cartridge, the pressure caused the contact pins to bend, while also compressing the ROM board within the cartridge. Over time, the repeated insertion and removal of cartridges led to the wear and tear of the pins, rendering them prone to damage.",
        "Protestants took a leading role in advocating for religious freedom, with the concept of freedom of conscience becoming a top priority on theological, philosophical, and political agendas. This development was sparked by Luther's refusal to recant his beliefs at the Diet of the Holy Roman Empire in Worms (1521), where he argued that faith is a free work of the Holy Spirit and cannot be coerced. As a result, persecuted groups like the Anabaptists and Huguenots demanded freedom of conscience, adopting a separation of church and state. In the early 17th century, Baptist leaders such as John Smyth and Thomas Helwys wrote tracts defending religious freedom, which in turn influenced the thinking of John Milton and John Locke on tolerance. Under the leadership of figures like Roger Williams, Thomas Hooker, and William Penn, colonies like Rhode Island, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania combined democratic governance with freedom of religion, providing safe havens for persecuted religious minorities, including Jews. The United States Declaration of Independence, Constitution, and Bill of Rights later enshrined these principles.",
        "Birds have a remarkably effective mechanism for oxygen diffusion into the blood, boasting a significantly higher surface area-to-gas-exchange-volume ratio than mammals - a tenfold increase. As a result, birds have a greater volume of blood in their capillaries per unit of lung volume compared to mammals. The arteries, comprising thick elastic muscles, are designed to withstand the pressure generated by ventricular constriction and become increasingly rigid as they move away from the heart. Blood flows through the arteries, which undergo vasoconstriction, and into arterioles, serving as a transportation system to distribute primarily oxygen and nutrients to all bodily tissues. As arterioles branch off from the heart and enter individual organs and tissues, they become further divided to increase surface area and slow blood flow. Upon reaching the capillaries, blood continues its journey, where gas exchange can occur. These capillaries are organized into capillary beds within tissues, allowing for efficient nutrient and oxygen delivery to the body's various organs and tissues.",
        "Notably, the men's basketball team boasts an impressive 1,600-plus wins, placing it among just 12 institutions to achieve this milestone. The team has also made 28 NCAA tournament appearances. Austin Carr, a former player, holds the record for the most points scored in a single tournament game with 61. Although they have not yet claimed the NCAA Tournament title, they were recognized as national champions by the Helms Athletic Foundation on two occasions. The team has a history of stunning upsets, including a notable 1974 victory that snapped UCLA's 88-game winning streak. In addition, they have defeated eight other top-ranked teams, with a total of nine wins against the number-one ranked team, ranking second behind UCLA's 10 all-time wins. The team plays its home games at the newly renovated Purcell Pavilion within the Edmund P. Joyce Center, which reopened in 2009-2010. Under the guidance of coach Mike Brey, who as of the 2014-15 season, the team continues to excel.",
        "Exactly one century after the fall of Constantinople in 1453, Pierre Belon documented in his 1553 publication, \"Observations\", that a unique mixture of pitch and bitumen, known as pissasphalto, was utilized in Dubrovnik for ship tarring, which was then exported to Venice's marketplace for public purchase. A Mechanics Magazine edition from 1838 mentions an early application of asphalt in France. A 1621 pamphlet authored by \"Monsieur d'Eyrinys\" claims to have discovered substantial asphalt reserves near Neufchatel, proposing its use in various capacities, including constructing air-tight granaries and shielding Paris' waterways from contamination by building arches to prevent dirt and waste from entering the city's watercourses.",
        "Marshall Field & Company was established in 1852 and quickly became the premier department store on Chicago's State Street, the main shopping thoroughfare in the Midwest. The upscale store attracted customers from across the region, who would travel by train and stay at nearby hotels. Over time, Marshall Field & Company expanded to become a major retail chain before rebranding as Macy's on September 9, 2006. Marshall Field's was renowned for its exceptional customer service, setting a standard for other department stores. The company also acquired the iconic Frango mints brand from Frederick & Nelson, which became closely associated with Marshall Field's and Chicago. Marshall Field's was at the forefront of innovation, introducing pioneering concepts such as the first European buying office in Manchester, England, and the first bridal registry. Additionally, the company introduced the concept of personal shoppers, offering this service free of charge to customers in every Field's store until the chain's eventual closure.",
        "Some street trams utilized conduit third-rail current collection systems, where a third rail was positioned below street level. The trams gathered power through a plough, which was accessed via a narrow slot in the road. In the United States, a significant portion of the former streetcar systems in Washington, D.C. (which ceased operations in 1962) and Manhattan employed this method to minimize the visual impact of electric traction's wires and poles. The remnants of this operating system can still be observed, for instance, on the track leading down the slope to the abandoned Kingsway Tramway Subway in central London, where the slot between the running rails is easily visible. Additionally, the P and Q Streets in the Georgetown neighborhood of Washington, D.C., west of Wisconsin Avenue, still display evidence of this mode of operation.",
        "According to the 2010 Census, over one million Asian Americans reside in New York City, a figure surpassing the combined totals of San Francisco and Los Angeles. Moreover, New York boasts the highest Asian population of any U.S. city proper. Notably, the Queens borough houses the state's largest Asian American population and the largest Andean population in the United States, making it the most ethnically diverse urban area globally. The Chinese population is experiencing rapid growth, with satellite Chinatowns emerging in Brooklyn, Flushing, Queens, and even expanding into suburban Nassau County on Long Island. New York has become the top destination for new Chinese immigrants, with large-scale immigration continuing to flow into the city and surrounding areas. In 2012, 6.3% of New York City's population was of Chinese descent, reflecting the significant cultural impact of this demographic.",
        "In their 2003 paper \"Human Genetic Diversity and the Nonexistence of Biological Races\", Jeffrey Long and Rick Kittles provide a detailed critique of the application of FST to human populations. They argue that the commonly cited figure of 85% genetic diversity is misleading, as it suggests that each human population contains an average of 85% of all genetic diversity. However, this statistic does not accurately reflect human population history, as it views all human groups as independent entities. Instead, Long and Kittles propose a more nuanced understanding of human group relationships, which acknowledges that some groups are ancestral to others and represent paraphyletic groups to their descendant groups. For instance, under the recent African origin theory, the human population in Africa is considered paraphyletic to all other human groups, as it represents the ancestral group from which all non-African populations derive. Moreover, non-African groups derive from a small, non-representative sample of African populations, further highlighting the limitations of the 85% figure.",
        "Libya's economic landscape underwent significant transformations, diverging from the socialist ideology outlined in The Green Book. Government officials claimed they were implementing a unique form of \"people's socialism\" instead of embracing capitalism outright. Gaddafi endorsed these reforms, advocating for widespread privatization in a March 2003 address. By 2004, Libya had attracted $40 billion in direct foreign investment, a staggering sixfold increase from the previous year, largely due to the privatization of the oil industry. However, not everyone was pleased with these changes, as public demonstrations erupted in response. The GPC cabinet, taken over by revolutionary hard-liners in March 2006, slowed the pace of reforms but did not halt them entirely. In 2010, plans were announced to privatize half of Libya's economy over the next decade, despite a lack of political liberalization, with Gaddafi maintaining significant control. Meanwhile, the government transferred more powers to municipal councils in March 2010. As a result, Libya witnessed a steady rise in foreign investment and economic activity.",
        "The French military campaign commenced in September 1806, as Napoleon outlined his strategic plan in a letter to Marshal Soult. This letter introduced the concept of \"le bataillon-carr\u00e9,\" or \"square battalion,\" which emphasized the importance of coordinated movements among the various corps of the Grande Arm\u00e9e. According to this system, the troops would march in close proximity, allowing for swift and effective support in the event of an attack on any single corps. With an army of 180,000 troops, Napoleon launched a swift invasion of Prussia, rapidly advancing along the right bank of the River Saale. As was his customary approach, his primary objective was to defeat a single enemy before reinforcements could alter the course of the war. Upon discovering the location of the Prussian army, the French forces turned west and crossed the Saale with overwhelming might. The twin battles of Jena and Auerstedt, fought on October 14, saw the French emerge victorious, convincingly demonstrating their military prowess.",
        "The timing of Germany's rapprochement with the Soviet Union was influenced by the dismissal of Maxim Litvinov, whose Jewish heritage was viewed unfavorably by Nazi Germany. In response, Stalin instructed Molotov to remove Jewish officials from the ministry. Litvinov's removal was seen as a significant shift, as his previous efforts to form an anti-fascist coalition and his advocacy for collective security with France and Britain had been viewed as a pro-Western stance by the Kremlin. His dismissal indicated that the Soviet Union was open to negotiations with Germany, which was a significant departure from its previous stance. Molotov's appointment sent a clear signal to Germany that the USSR was willing to engage in talks. Additionally, the dismissal served as a signal to France and Britain that the Soviet Union was willing to consider negotiations with Germany. A British official commented on Litvinov's departure, noting that he was a skilled diplomat and a valuable \"shock-absorber,\" while Molotov's approach was more in line with traditional Soviet ideology than with diplomatic norms. Carr argued that the Soviet Union's replacement of Foreign Minister Litvinov with Molotov marked a significant turning point in its relations with Germany.",
        "Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi was vehemently criticized by western governments and media, who portrayed him as a ruthless dictator who ruled with an iron fist. The Reagan administration went as far as to label him \"Public Enemy No. 1\" and infamously dubbed him the \"mad dog of the Middle East\". Critics argued that under Gaddafi's regime, the Libyan people lived in a state of perpetual fear, as his government exercised pervasive surveillance over civilians. Western commentators often described Libya as a police state, where opposition voices were silenced and human rights abuses were rampant. Human rights organizations, such as Human Rights Watch, reported that hundreds of political opponents were arrested without due process, and many were subjected to torture and extrajudicial execution, including a reported massacre at Abu Salim prison on June 29, 1996, which allegedly claimed the lives of many.",
        "A true predator is characterized by its ability to kill and consume another living organism. Unlike other predators that inflict harm on their prey, this type of predator ultimately kills its prey. Predators exhibit different hunting strategies, such as active pursuit or ambush tactics, to capture their prey. Some predators, like jaguars and humans, kill their large prey and then dismember or chew it before consumption, whereas others, like bottlenose dolphins and certain birds, swallow their prey whole. Some animals, such as domesticated cats and dogs, may employ different strategies depending on the situation, devouring large insects whole while dismembering larger prey like rabbits. Additionally, certain predators use venom to subdue their prey before consuming it, exemplifying the diverse and effective tactics employed by predators to obtain their next meal.",
        "Throughout ancient history, the Israelites experienced two periods of political independence, initially under the Biblical judges and later during the United Monarchy. Following the collapse of the United Monarchy, the land was partitioned into the kingdoms of Israel and Judah. The term \"Jew\" originated from the Roman \"Judean\", referring to individuals from the southern kingdom of Judah. Although the shift from \"Israelites\" to \"Jews\" is not explicitly mentioned in the Torah, it is evident in the Book of Esther, written in the 4th century BCE, which belongs to the Ketuvim section of the Jewish Tanakh. In 587 BC, Nebuchadnezzar II, the ruler of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, laid siege to Jerusalem, destroyed the First Temple, and deported the prominent citizens of Judah. By 586 BC, Judah had ceased to be an independent kingdom, leaving its remaining Jews without a state. The Babylonian exile came to an end in 539 BCE when the Achaemenid Empire conquered Babylon, and Cyrus the Great allowed the Jews to return to their homeland.",
        "According to Van Praag, the Ming court established connections with Tibet primarily to obtain horses urgently needed for their purposes. In contrast, Wang and Nyima contend that these interactions were not diplomatic in nature, as Tibet was under Ming control since Tibetan leaders held positions within the Ming administration. The collection of horses from Tibet was, in fact, a mandatory \"corv\u00e9e\" tax, implying that Tibetans were engaged in domestic affairs rather than diplomatic activities. Sperling notes that the Ming simultaneously purchased horses in the Kham region while simultaneously battling Tibetan tribes in Amdo and receiving Tibetan embassies in Nanjing. Moreover, he argues that the Tibetan lamas' visits to the Ming court were largely aimed at fostering commercial exchanges between their entourage and Ming Chinese merchants and officials. Kolma\u0161 suggests that while the Ming adopted a laissez-faire approach towards Tibet, limiting the size of Tibetan retinues, Tibetans sought to maintain a tributary relationship with the Ming due to the imperial patronage it offered.",
        "The Guangxu Emperor passed away on November 14, 1908, and the following day, Empress Dowager Cixi succumbed to death. Controversy persisted that she or Yuan Shikai had orchestrated the poisoning of the Guangxu Emperor, and a posthumous autopsy revealed alarming levels of arsenic in his remains. In the aftermath, Puyi, the two-year-old son of Zaifeng, Prince Chun, and nephew to the childless Guangxu Emperor, was designated as the successor, with Zaifeng assuming regency. This move was preceded by the ousting of General Yuan Shikai from his influential positions. Subsequently, in April 1911, Zaifeng established a cabinet, comprising two vice-premiers. Although this cabinet was officially recognized, it was also informally referred to as \"The Royal Cabinet\" due to the presence of five members who were royal family members among its thirteen members.",
        "Birds typically shed their feathers regularly, a process known as moult. After breeding, the standard plumage is referred to as the \"non-breeding\" or \"basic\" plumage, while breeding plumages or variations are classified as \"alternate\" plumages under the Humphrey-Parkes system. Most species moult annually, although some may experience two moults per year, and large birds of prey may only moult once every few years. Moult patterns differ across species, with passerines, for instance, replacing flight feathers one by one, starting with the innermost primary. As the fifth or sixth primary is replaced, the outermost tertiaries begin to drop, followed by the sequential dropping of secondaries from innermost to outermost (centrifugal moult). Meanwhile, the greater primary coverts are moulted in sync with the overlapping primary feathers. A few species, such as certain birds, exhibit unique moulting patterns.",
        "In southeastern Europe, the first agrarian societies emerged in the 7th millennium BC, with a notable farming site discovered in Vasht\u00ebmi, Albania, dating back to 6,500 BC. The Balkans and Central Europe have yielded anthropomorphic figurines since 6,000 BC (La Hoguette) and 5,800 BC, respectively. The Sesklo culture in Thessaly, which later expanded across the Balkans, gave rise to Star\u010devo-K\u00f6r\u00f6s, Linearbandkeramik, and Vin\u010da cultural complexes. As a result of cultural diffusion and population migrations, Neolithic traditions spread west and northward to reach northwestern Europe around 4,500 BC. The Vin\u010da culture may have developed the earliest known writing system, Vin\u010da signs, although archaeologist Shan Winn suggests that these symbols might have represented pictograms and ideograms rather than a fully developed writing system.",
        "Yale's representation in national elections since the Vietnam War has been attributed to various factors. Many sources highlight the campus activism that has been a hallmark of Yale since the 1960s, as well as the intellectual influence of Reverend William Sloane Coffin on several future candidates. Yale President Richard Levin credits the university's focus on cultivating \"a laboratory for future leaders\" as a key factor, a priority that dates back to the presidencies of Alfred Whitney Griswold and Kingman Brewster. Richard H. Brodhead, former dean of Yale College and now president of Duke University, notes that Yale places significant emphasis on community orientation during the admissions process, which is complemented by a strong tradition of volunteerism on campus. Yale historian Gaddis Smith observes that the 20th century saw a culture of organized activity at Yale, which led to notable student leaders such as John Kerry, George Pataki, and Joseph Lieberman. Camille Paglia also points to Yale's history",
        "Among major Canadian cities, St. John's stands out as the most fog-shrouded (124 days), wind-battered (24.3 km/h average speed), and overcast (1,497 hours of sunshine). In contrast to other Canadian cities, St. John's enjoys a relatively mild winter, making it the mildest wintering spot outside of British Columbia. Despite its frequent and often heavy precipitation, which occurs throughout the year, St. John's experiences its driest season in summer, with only occasional thunderstorms. Conversely, the wettest months typically fall between October and January, with December being the most precipitation-heavy, averaging nearly 165 millimeters of rainfall. This unusual winter precipitation peak is uncommon in humid continental climates, which usually experience a late spring or early summer precipitation maximum.",
        "The torch relay in Paris, which took place on April 7, kicked off at the Eiffel Tower's first level and concluded at Stade Charl\u00e9ty. Initially, the relay was expected to span 28 kilometers, but it was curtailed by Chinese officials amid widespread protests from pro-Tibet and human rights activists who sought to disrupt or halt the procession. As a result, a scheduled town hall ceremony was cancelled at the behest of Chinese authorities, and the torch was transported by bus instead of being carried by athletes, as originally planned. Paris City officials had previously announced plans to greet the Olympic flame with peaceful protests when it arrived in the French capital. To emphasize their stance, the city government displayed a banner reading \"Paris defends human rights everywhere\" during the relay.",
        "In various surveys conducted in Europe and the United States, green is consistently linked with nature, life, health, youth, renewal, hope, and envy. While green often holds positive connotations, it also has seemingly contradictory associations in these regions, including death, sickness, and the devil. In stark contrast, in China, green is a symbol of fertility and happiness, reflecting its positive cultural significance. In the past, when clothing colors signified social status, green was worn by merchants, bankers, and the gentry, whereas red was reserved for the nobility. This dichotomy is exemplified in the Mona Lisa, painted by Leonardo da Vinci, who wears green to signify her non-noble background. Similarly, the green benches in the British House of Commons contrast with the red benches in the House of Lords, reflecting the distinct social hierarchy. Moreover, green has also been traditionally associated with safety and permission, as evident in the \"go ahead\" connotation of a green light and the permanent residency granted by a green card.",
        "During this era, Libya made a significant comeback on the global stage. In 1999, Libya initiated clandestine negotiations with the British government to normalize their diplomatic ties. Subsequently, in 2001, Gaddafi publicly condemned the 9/11 attacks orchestrated by al-Qaeda, offering condolences to the victims and urging Libya's involvement in the War on Terror against militant Islamism. Concurrently, his administration continued to suppress domestic Islamist movements, while Gaddafi advocated for the broader implementation of Sharia law. Notably, Libya strengthened its ties with China and North Korea, with Chinese President Jiang Zemin visiting Libya in April 2002. The Iraq War's aftermath influenced Libya's decision in December 2003 to relinquish its weapons of mass destruction, dismantling its chemical and nuclear weapons programs. This move led to improved relations with the US, and UK Prime Minister Tony Blair even met with Gaddafi in the Libyan desert in March 2004. Shortly after, Gaddafi paid a visit to the European Union's headquarters in Brussels, marking a significant improvement in his country's international standing.",
        "In 356, Constantius banished Liberius, giving him just three days to comply. Liberius was forced to leave for Beroea in Thrace, where he faced a bleak exile. Despite the emperor's offer of expensive gifts if he would renounce his Christian beliefs and adopt Arianism, Liberius refused. Constantius attempted to win him over with a generous offer of 500 pieces of gold to cover his expenses, but Liberius declined, suggesting the emperor use the money to reward his flatterers instead. Liberius also rejected a similar gift from the empress, instructing the messenger to believe in Christ and cease persecuting the Church of God. When attempts were made to leave the gifts in the Church, Liberius promptly removed them. In response, Constantius summoned Liberius under close guard to Milan, where, in a recorded conference with Theodoret, Liberius boldly asserted that Athanasius had been exonerated at Sardica and his accusers had been proven to be calumniators and impostors, deeming it unjust to condemn him.",
        "Kanye West's debut album, The College Dropout, was ultimately released by Roc-A-Fella in February 2004, which catapulted to number two on the Billboard 200 chart. The album's debut single, \"Through the Wire\", peaked at number 15 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart for five weeks. His subsequent single, \"Slow Jamz\", featuring Twista and Jamie Foxx, achieved even greater success, marking the trio's first number one hit. The College Dropout garnered widespread critical acclaim, earning top album of the year honors from two prominent music publications, and has since been consistently ranked among the greatest hip-hop works and debut albums by artists. The album's fourth single, \"Jesus Walks\", arguably introduced West to a broader audience; the song's lyrics focus on faith and Christianity. Despite industry expectations that a song with such overtly religious themes would fail to resonate with a wider audience, \"Jesus Walks\" managed to reach the top 20 on the Billboard pop charts.",
        "On April 26, 1864, the Montana Territory was established through the passage of the Organic Act. Prior to its official formation, however, families began settling in the region and establishing schools. The initial educational institutions were subscription-based, often taking place in the teacher's home. One of the earliest recorded formal schools was established at Fort Owen in the Bitterroot Valley in 1862, catering to Indian children and the offspring of Fort Owen employees. This inaugural school term commenced in early winter and concluded on February 28, with Mr. Robinson serving as the instructor. Another early subscription school was founded by Thomas Dimsdale in Virginia City in 1863, with students paying $1.75 per week to attend. Following the inaugural meeting of the Montana Territorial Legislative Assembly in 1864, the first legislature authorized counties to impose taxes for schools, thereby laying the groundwork for public education.",
        "The culmination of identity formation is self-esteem, which encompasses one's perceptions and emotions about their self-concept and identity. Theories on self-esteem generally concur that individuals across genders and age groups strive to preserve, defend, and augment their self-esteem. In contrast to common misconceptions, research has not found a significant decline in self-esteem during adolescence. Instead, \"barometric self-esteem\" - which fluctuates rapidly and can cause considerable distress and anxiety - remains stable in its baseline level throughout adolescence. The reliability of global self-esteem scales has been disputed, and many experts propose that more nuanced scales could provide a more accurate understanding of the adolescent experience. Girls tend to experience high self-esteem when surrounded by supportive friendships, with the primary function of these relationships being the provision of social and moral support. When engaged in such friendships, they are more likely to feel valued and confident.",
        "The genetic legacy of Bermuda's population has been largely erased by the cultural assimilation that has taken place over the past four centuries. Today, there is little distinction between black and white Bermudians, aside from characteristics exhibited by recent immigrant groups. This was not the case in the 17th century, when the island's early settlers were predominantly white English Protestants, accompanied by smaller numbers of Irish and Scots who had been displaced by the English Civil War. Meanwhile, non-white groups included free black laborers from the West Indies, enslaved Africans captured by Bermudian privateers from Spanish and Portuguese ships, and Native Americans from various tribes along the Atlantic coast, possibly extending as far as Mexico. By the 19th century, the English-speaking white population had lost its numerical dominance.",
        "Intel had attempted to persuade Apple to switch the Macintosh platform to Intel processors, but ultimately failed. Apple realized that Intel's CISC architecture was not competitive with RISC processors. Although the Motorola 68040 offered similar features to the Intel 80486 and outperformed it on a clock-for-clock basis, the 486 could be clocked at a higher frequency without overheating issues, particularly the clock-doubled i486DX2, which ran the CPU logic at twice the external bus speed. This gave IBM-compatible systems with the 486 a significant performance advantage over their Macintosh equivalents. Apple's product design and engineering strategy hindered matters by initially limiting the use of the '040 to their high-end Quadras, while the 486 was readily available to OEMs and enthusiasts who built their own machines. By late 1991, as the higher-end Macintosh desktop lineup transitioned to the '040, Apple was unable to",
        "Notwithstanding the passage of time, some hard rock bands from the 1970s and 1980s managed to maintain a successful recording career. Bon Jovi, for instance, continued to produce hits, with \"It's My Life\" from their double platinum-certified album Crush (2000) being a notable example. AC/DC released the platinum-certified Stiff Upper Lip (2000), while Aerosmith's Just Push Play (2001) reached number two platinum status, featuring the Top 10 hit \"Jaded\" and a blues cover album, Honkin' on Bobo, which peaked at number five in 2004. Heart's Red Velvet Car in 2010 marked their first Top 10 album since the early 90s, making them the first female-led hard rock band to achieve Top 10 albums spanning five decades. Furthermore, Van Halen reunited in 2004 with Hagar, and again in 2007 with Roth, while The Who delayed their reunion tour in 2002 due to the passing of bassist John Entwistle, eventually performing together in 2006. Black Sabbath also reunited, initially with Osbourne from 1997 to 2006 and then with Dio from 2006 to 2010. Even Led Zeppelin staged a one-off performance in 2007, revitalizing interest in their previous work.",
        "To mitigate the risk of out-of-phase supplies mixing, it is crucial to maintain strict isolation between sections of power lines fed from different feeder stations. This is accomplished through Neutral Sections, also referred to as Phase Breaks, which are typically installed at feeder stations and midpoints between them. Although only half of these sections are operational at any given time, the other half serve as a backup, allowing a feeder station to be shut down while power is rerouted from adjacent feeder stations. Neutral Sections typically comprise an earthed wire section, separated from the live wires on either side by insulating material, such as ceramic beads, to ensure a smooth transition for the pantograph. This earthed section prevents an arc from forming between the live sections, as the voltage difference may exceed the normal system voltage if the live sections are on different phases. Additionally, it prevents the protective circuit breakers from being overwhelmed by the significant current that would flow, thereby ensuring a safe and reliable power transmission.",
        "During the Carolingian era, artistic creations were primarily crafted for the exclusive benefit of a select group of individuals surrounding the royal court, as well as the monasteries and churches that received their support. This art movement was characterized by a revival of the grandeur and classical elements found in Roman and Byzantine art, while also incorporating the ornate and energetic styles of Insular art from the British Isles. The latter's fusion of Irish Celtic and Anglo-Saxon Germanic ornamentation with Mediterranean forms, particularly the book, laid the groundwork for many artistic trends that would persist throughout the medieval period. Unfortunately, the majority of surviving artwork from this period consists of illuminated manuscripts and intricately carved ivories, which were originally intended for metalwork pieces that have since been melted down. While objects made of precious metals were considered the most esteemed form of art, almost all have been lost, except for a few notable examples like the Cross of Lothair, several reliquaries, and archaeological discoveries such as the Sutton Hoo burial, the Gourdon hoard from Merovingian France, the Guarrazar hoard from Visigothic Spain, and the Nagyszentmikl\u00f3s finds from Byzantine territories.",
        "Cultivating cotton effectively necessitates a prolonged frost-free period, abundant sunlight, and moderate rainfall, typically ranging from 600 to 1,200 mm (24 to 47 in). While the soil should be relatively heavy, the level of nutrients does not need to be exceptionally high. The tropics and subtropics in both the Northern and Southern hemispheres generally meet these conditions, although a significant portion of modern cotton production occurs in areas with limited rainfall, where irrigation makes up for the deficit. Typically, cotton production for a given year begins shortly after the harvest of the preceding autumn. Due to its natural perennial nature, cotton is often grown as an annual crop to manage pest populations. In the Northern hemisphere, the planting season for cotton typically commences between early February and early June. The South Plains region in the United States is a notable example of an area suitable for cotton cultivation.",
        "During Darwin's lifetime, his book was translated into various languages, although difficulties arose in conveying complex concepts and metaphors, and some translations were influenced by the translator's personal agenda. To facilitate the process, Darwin distributed presentation copies in France and Germany, trusting that suitable translators would emerge, who would then make their own arrangements with local publishers. He was pleased to receive the attention of the renowned naturalist and geologist Heinrich Georg Bronn, but the German translation published in 1860 unfortunately reflected Bronn's own opinions, introducing topics that Darwin had deliberately omitted. Bronn translated \"favoured races\" as \"perfected races\", and added essays on the origin of life, as well as a concluding chapter exploring religious implications, which were partly inspired by Bronn's adherence to Naturphilosophie. In 1862, Bronn released a revised edition based on the third English edition and Darwin's suggested additions, but sadly, he passed away shortly after due to a heart attack. Darwin maintained close communication with Julius Victor Carus, who published an improved translation in 1867.",
        "During the Capetian dynasty, France gradually strengthened its authority over the nobility, expanding its influence from the \u00cele-de-France to encompass a larger portion of the country throughout the 11th and 12th centuries. In this period, the Dukes of Normandy emerged as a formidable rival, with William the Conqueror, who reigned from 1035 to 1087, conquering England in 1066 and establishing a cross-channel empire that persisted in various forms throughout the Middle Ages. The Normans also settled in Sicily and southern Italy, following Robert Guiscard's arrival in 1059, which led to the establishment of a duchy that later evolved into the Kingdom of Sicily. Under the Angevin dynasty, which ruled England from 1154 to 1189 under Henry II and from 1189 to 1199 under Richard I, the English monarchy controlled both England and significant territories in France, acquired through Henry II's inheritance.",
        "In 2009, IGN listed the Xbox 360 as the sixth-greatest video game console of all time, out of a pool of 25. Although it didn't lead the sales charts for its generation, the Xbox 360 was hailed by TechRadar as the most influential, thanks to its pioneering efforts in digital media distribution and online gaming through Xbox Live, as well as its introduction of game achievement awards. PC Magazine recognized the Xbox 360 as the prototype for online gaming, crediting it with showing that online gaming communities could flourish in the console sector. Five years after its initial launch, the critically acclaimed Kinect motion capture camera was released, breaking the record for the fastest-selling consumer electronic device in history, and extending the console's lifespan. Edge magazine ranked the Xbox 360 as the second-best console of the 1993-2013 period, noting that it boasted its own social network, cross-game chat, a constant stream of new indie games, and the best versions of most multi-format games, outperforming its rivals in many ways.",
        "Following the death of his father, Sviatoslav I, in 972, Vladimir succeeded him as prince of Novgorod. However, after his half-brother Yaropolk murdered their brother Oleg and seized power in Rus in 976, Vladimir was compelled to flee to Scandinavia. In Norway, he secured the support of his relative, Earl H\u00e5kon Sigurdsson, and with his assistance, Vladimir assembled a Viking army, which he used to reclaim Novgorod and Kiev from Yaropolk's control. Notably, as Prince of Kiev, Vladimir oversaw the Christianization of Kievan Rus', a process that commenced in 988. According to the Primary Chronicle, Vladimir's decision to adopt a new faith, abandoning the traditional idol-worship of the Slavs, was preceded by a diplomatic mission to various parts of Europe. He dispatched his most trusted advisors and warriors to different regions to gather information about Christianity and its practices.",
        "Galicia experienced a relatively peaceful period during the war, as the initial coup attempt was successful and the region remained under Nationalist control throughout the conflict. Although no major battles took place, the region was still subject to repression and violence. As a result, all political parties, labor unions, and Galician nationalist organizations, including the Seminario de Estudos Galegos, were abolished. Additionally, Galicia's statute of autonomy was revoked, along with those of Catalonia and the Basque provinces once they were conquered. According to historian Carlos Fern\u00e1ndez Santander, at least 4,200 people lost their lives due to extrajudicial killings or summary trials, with victims including republicans, communists, Galician nationalists, socialists, and anarchists. This toll also included the civil governors of all four Galician provinces, as well as prominent individuals such as Juana Capdevielle, the wife of the governor of A Coru\u00f1a, and \u00c1nxel Casal, the socialist mayor of Santiago de Compostela.",
        "The majority of fatty acids are non-essential, as the human body can synthesize them from other fatty acids, albeit by expending energy in the process. In contrast, two essential fatty acids, omega-3 and omega-6, must be obtained through dietary intake. A harmonious balance of these essential fatty acids is believed to be crucial for overall health, although conclusive experimental evidence has yet to be established. Both omega-3 and omega-6 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids serve as precursors for a group of eicosanoids called prostaglandins, which play various roles throughout the human body. These fatty acids can be regarded as hormones, given their hormone-like functions. Omega-3 eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), which can be produced in the human body from alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) or obtained through marine food sources, acts as a building block for series 3 prostaglandins (for instance, PGE3, a weakly inflammatory compound). Similarly, omega-6 dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA) serves as a building block for series 1 prostaglandins.",
        "In ancient Roman society, public priests were appointed by the collegia and held permanent religious authority, bestowed upon them by the divine. This esteemed position granted them a lifetime of influence, privilege, and immunity. As a result, civil and religious laws regulated the number and type of religious offices an individual and their family could hold. The religious code was rooted in tradition and was collegial, influencing political decisions, capable of overturning them, and resistant to personal exploitation. Becoming a priest was a prestigious honor, but one that came with significant financial burdens. In traditional Roman practice, priests did not receive a stipend, relying on cult donations to fund their activities. These donations belonged to the deity, and the priest was responsible for providing the cult, even if public funding was insufficient. This often required priests to subsidize acolytes and other cult expenses from their personal funds. For those who had achieved their goals in the Cursus honorum, a lifetime of service in military or political life, or ideally both, was often a prerequisite for seeking or being granted permanent priesthood.",

Sasha Fierce, held at Manhattan's Sony Club on October 22, 2008. The album, released in the United States on November 18, 2008, formally introduces Sasha Fierce, an alter ego conceived during the creation of her 2003 hit single \"Crazy in Love\". The album's first week sales reached 482,000 copies, debuting at number one on the Billboard 200 and securing Beyonc\u00e9's third consecutive number-one album in the US. The album boasts a range of hit singles, including the number-one track \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\" and top-five hits \"If I Were a Boy\" and \"Halo\". The latter song's success in the US contributed to it becoming Beyonc\u00e9's longest-running Hot 100 single, further solidifying her top-ten presence on the chart.",
        "In June 1858, while working on his magnum opus on Natural Selection, Darwin received a package from Wallace, who was stationed on the Maluku Islands (Ternate and Gilolo). The package contained twenty pages detailing an evolutionary mechanism, a response to Darwin's earlier encouragement, with a request that he share it with Lyell if he deemed it worthy. Notably, the mechanism mirrored Darwin's own theory. In a letter to Lyell, Darwin lamented that \"your words have come true with a vengeance,... forestalled\" and vowed to immediately offer to publish Wallace's work in any chosen journal, acknowledging that his own original ideas would likely be diminished. Lyell and Hooker concurred that a joint publication combining Wallace's pages with excerpts from Darwin's 1844 essay and 1857 letter to Gray should be presented at the Linnean Society. On July 1, 1858, the papers were titled \"On the Tendency\".",

        "Various unique match stipulations have been developed in modern professional wrestling, each with its own distinct winning conditions. One of the most well-known is the ladder match, where wrestlers or teams must ascend a ladder to claim a prize suspended above the ring. To emerge victorious, the wrestler or team must manage to incapacitate their opponents long enough for one individual to scale the ladder and secure the prize. As a result, the ladder often serves as a weapon in the match. The prizes up for grabs can range from a championship belt to a document granting a future title shot or other documents of significance to the wrestlers involved, such as a cash prize. Another popular specialty match is the battle royal, where a large number of wrestlers \u2013 typically between 20 and 30 \u2013 enter the ring simultaneously. Upon the match's commencement, the objective is straightforward: the last wrestler standing in the ring emerges victorious.",
        "Following Cassander's demise in 298 BCE, Demetrius, who retained a substantial loyal army and naval fleet, launched a surprise invasion of Macedon, seized the throne (294 BCE), and conquered Thessaly and most of central Greece (293-291 BCE). However, his fortunes took a downturn in 288 BCE when Lysimachus of Thrace and Pyrrhus of Epirus simultaneously invaded Macedon from two fronts, ultimately dividing the kingdom among themselves. Demetrius fled to central Greece with his mercenaries and began building a power base there and in the northern Peloponnese. He subsequently laid siege to Athens once more when they defected from his side, but later forged an alliance with the Athenians and Ptolemy, allowing him to cross into Asia Minor and wage war against Lysimachus' territories in Ionia, leaving his son Antigonus Gonatas in charge of Greece. Although he enjoyed initial successes, Demetrius was eventually compelled to surrender to Seleucus in 285 BCE and later perished in captivity. In the aftermath, Lysimachus,",
        "The pioneering work that effectively communicated scientific concepts and knowledge to a broad audience in plain language, with entertainment in mind, was Bernard de Fontenelle's \"Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds\" in 1686. This book was specifically designed for women with an interest in scientific writing, sparking a wave of similar publications. Unlike complex academic articles and books, these popular works employed a conversational style, making scientific information more accessible to readers. Charles Leadbetter's \"Astronomy\" (1727) promised to provide \"short and easy rules and astronomical tables\" for a wider audience. Voltaire's \"El\u00e9ments de la philosophie de Newton\" (1738) introduced French readers to Newtonianism and the Principia. \u00c9milie du Ch\u00e2telet's posthumous translation of the Principia in 1756 further disseminated Newton's theories beyond academic and university circles.",
        "In the year 633 AD, Rashidun Arabs launched a conquest of Iran, ultimately claiming the region by 651 AD. This led to a significant shift in the religious demographics, as many Iranians converted from their indigenous faiths of Manichaeism and Zoroastrianism to Sunni Islam. Arabic became the dominant official language, while Persian remained the language of everyday communication and literary expression. As a result, Iran played a pivotal role in the Islamic Golden Age, yielding numerous influential scholars, scientists, artists, and thinkers. The Safavid Dynasty's rise to power in 1501 precipitated a significant transformation, as the Iranian people converted from Sunni Islam to Twelver Shia Islam, establishing it as the official religion of the region. This pivotal shift in religious affiliation had a profound impact on Iranian and Muslim history. Under the rule of Nader Shah, starting from 1736, Iran reached its territorial peak since the Sassanid Empire, briefly boasting the most powerful empire of its time. However, during the 19th century, Iran suffered the loss of significant territories in the Caucasus, which had been a part of the country's concept for centuries, to neighboring Imperial Russia. Growing discontent eventually culminated in",
        "A 2002 Guardian report revealed that between 1940 and 1979, the Ministry of Defence covertly transformed substantial portions of the country into a massive experimental site to conduct a series of clandestine germ warfare tests on the general public. Many of these experiments entailed releasing potentially hazardous chemicals and microorganisms over extensive areas, without alerting the public to the risks. The Ministry of Defence maintains that these trials were aimed at simulating germ warfare and that the tests posed no harm. However, families residing in areas affected by the tests are experiencing children born with birth defects and physical and mental disabilities, prompting calls for a public inquiry. According to the report, these tests had a significant impact on an estimated millions of people, including a period between 1961 and 1968 where over a million individuals along the south coast of England, from Torquay to the New Forest, were exposed to bacteria such as E. coli and Bacillus globigii, a microorganism that mimics anthrax.",
        "The early 1980s witnessed significant transformations within the hard rock landscape, marked by the untimely passing of Bon Scott, AC/DC's lead vocalist, and John Bonham, Led Zeppelin's drummer. While Zeppelin disbanded shortly after, AC/DC persevered, releasing the iconic album Back in Black (1980) with new lead singer Brian Johnson. This album became the fifth-best-selling album in the US and the second-best-selling worldwide. Meanwhile, Black Sabbath parted ways with Ozzy Osbourne in 1979, replacing him with Ronnie James Dio, formerly of Rainbow, which resulted in a fresh sound and a creative resurgence beginning with Heaven and Hell (1980). Osbourne ventured into a solo career with Blizzard of Ozz (1980), featuring American guitarist Randy Rhoads. Some acts, like Queen, shifted away from their hard rock roots and towards pop rock, while others, including",
        "Feynman's innovative diagrams of interacting particles in spacetime enabled him to model the fundamental forces of physics by analyzing the spins of those particles and the ranges of their couplings. Building on this foundation, he developed the parton model to explain the strong interactions governing nucleon scattering. The parton model served as a complementary framework to Murray Gell-Mann's quark model, which was being developed at Caltech. Although the relationship between the two models was unclear, Gell-Mann dismissed Feynman's partons as \"put-ons.\" In the mid-1960s, physicists viewed quarks as mere bookkeeping devices for symmetry numbers, as the statistics of the Omega-minus particle, if interpreted as three identical strange quarks bound together, seemed impossible if quarks were real particles. The Stanford linear accelerator's deep inelastic scattering experiments in the late 1960s, similar to Ernest Rutherford's pioneering experiment on scattering alpha particles on gold nuclei, ultimately revealed the reality of quarks and their importance in understanding particle interactions.",

The album swiftly debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 chart, making it her fifth consecutive chart-topper in the US. Notably, she became the first female artist to have her first five studio albums debut at number one in the chart's history. The album received widespread critical acclaim and commercial success, selling one million digital copies worldwide within six days. The unconventional release caught the attention of The New York Times, which deemed it a significant event. Musically, the album is an electro-R&B fusion that explores darker themes not previously addressed in her work, including bulimia, postnatal depression, and the anxieties of marriage and motherhood. The single \"Drunk in Love\", featuring Jay Z, peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.

        "Prior to the early 20th century, medical treatments for infections relied heavily on traditional remedies. As early as 2,000 years ago, people described using mixtures with antimicrobial properties to combat infections. Various ancient civilizations, including the Egyptians and Greeks, employed carefully selected mold and plant extracts to treat infections. Later, laboratory observations of antibiosis between microorganisms led to the discovery of natural antibacterial compounds produced by microorganisms. Notably, Louis Pasteur remarked that harnessing the antagonism between certain bacteria could potentially offer the greatest hope for therapeutic advances. The term \"antibiosis,\" meaning \"against life,\" was coined by French bacteriologist Jean Paul Vuillemin to describe this phenomenon exhibited by early antibacterial agents. The concept of antibiosis was first documented in 1877 in the context of bacteria, with Louis Pasteur playing a key role in its discovery.",
        "In many instances, particularly in situations involving three or more parties, no single party is capable of exercising sole authority, prompting parties to collaborate and form coalition governments. This trend has been gaining prominence in Ireland's political landscape since the 1980s and is consistently observed at national, state, and communal levels in Germany. Similarly, Iceland has never had a government led by a single party since its inception, with coalition governments typically consisting of the Independence Party and another party, often the Social Democratic Alliance. Ireland has also followed a similar pattern since 1989, with no party having held power independently. Instead, coalition governments have been formed, with either Fianna F\u00e1il or Fine Gael leading the way. The existence of coalition governments can facilitate political change more effectively compared to one-party or two-party dominant systems.",
        "In response to the growing concern about climate change, the City of Melbourne set a bold goal in 2002 to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2020. Moreland City Council also launched the Zero Moreland program, but not all metropolitan municipalities have followed suit. For instance, the City of Glen Eira opted out of carbon neutrality in 2009. Melbourne's urban landscape is characterized by a sprawling low-density housing, which has led to a high reliance on cars and limited public transportation options, except in the inner city areas. The city's vegetation is predominantly composed of non-native European species, which often harbor invasive species and noxious weeds. Invasive urban pests, such as the common myna, feral pigeon, brown rat, European wasp, common starling, and red fox, are prevalent. Furthermore, some outlying suburbs, particularly in the Yarra Valley and the hills to the north-east and east, have experienced extended periods without regenerative fires, resulting in a lack of saplings and undergrowth.",

        "The Royal Assent ceremony, traditionally held in the Senate, takes place outside the House of Commons due to the sovereign's customary absence from the latter. On the day of the event, the Speaker of the Senate reads a notice from the governor general's secretary, announcing the arrival of the viceroy or a deputy. The Senate is then prohibited from adjourning until after the ceremony. The Speaker takes their seat beside the throne, accompanied by the Mace Bearer, who holds the mace. The governor general enters and assumes the Speaker's chair, after which the Usher of the Black Rod is instructed by the Speaker to summon the Members of Parliament. The MPs, led by the Sergeant-at-Arms carrying the House of Commons' mace, return to the Senate. In the Senate, those from the Commons stand behind the bar, while Black Rod stands beside the governor general. Once assembled, the governor general nods their head to signify Royal Assent to the presented bills, excluding appropriation bills.",
        "Scotland maintained its independence as a kingdom until 1603, when the Scottish monarch inherited the English and Irish thrones. The 17th century was marked by turmoil, religious polarization, and conflict. The English colonization of Ireland in the 16th century was expanded by large-scale Scottish and English settlements in Ulster. The religious divide deepened, and the English monarch clashed with parliament over his tolerant stance towards Catholicism. This led to the English Civil War, also known as the War of the Three Kingdoms, which resulted in the establishment of a revolutionary republic in England. Ireland, predominantly Catholic, remained largely loyal to the king. Following defeat at the hands of the parliamentary army, large-scale land distributions from loyal Irish nobility to English commoners in the parliamentary army's service laid the groundwork for the emergence of a new Ascendancy class. Over the next century, this class would supplant the English (Hiberno-Norman) and Gaelic Irish elites.",
        "By the early 18th century, the Maratha Kingdom had evolved into the Maratha Empire under the leadership of the Peshwas, or prime ministers. A pivotal moment in this transformation was the Marathas' victory over a Mughal army in the Battle of Delhi in 1737. The Marathas continued their military campaigns against the Mughals, the Nizam, the Nawab of Bengal, and the Durrani Empire, expanding their territorial reach. Gordon highlights the Marathas' strategic approach to expanding their empire, which involved initiating annual raids, collecting ransoms from villages and towns, and eventually taking control of the region. He uses the example of the Malwa region to illustrate this process. The Marathas established a well-organized system of public administration, characterized by attention to detail, which enabled them to successfully raise revenue in districts that had been ravaged by years of raids, often to levels previously enjoyed.",
        "In 1939, the Bureau initiated a confidential list of individuals who would be detained in the event of war with Axis powers. The majority of the listed individuals were Issei community leaders, as the FBI investigation built upon an existing Naval Intelligence index that had focused on Japanese Americans in Hawaii and the West Coast. However, the list also included many German and Italian nationals. Robert Shivers, head of the Honolulu office, secured permission from Hoover to begin detaining those on the list on December 7, 1941, as the attack on Pearl Harbor was still unfolding. Following the attack, mass arrests and home searches (in most cases conducted without warrants) commenced, and over the next few weeks, more than 5,500 Issei men were taken into FBI custody. On February 19, 1942, President Franklin Roosevelt issued Executive Order 9066, authorizing the removal of Japanese Americans from the West Coast. Despite this, FBI Director Hoover expressed opposition to the policy.",
        "The body's response to an antigen is influenced by several factors, including age, antigen type, maternal influences, and the location where the antigen is presented. At birth, newborns are in a state of physiological immunodeficiency due to the suppression of both their innate and adaptive immune responses. While their immune system responds well to protein antigens, it has limited effectiveness against glycoproteins and polysaccharides. This is why many infections acquired by newborns are caused by low-virulence microorganisms like Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas. In newborns, the ability to activate the complement system and opsonic activity is significantly limited. For instance, the average level of C3 in a newborn is about 65% of that found in an adult. Furthermore, phagocytic activity is impaired in newborns due to lower opsonic activity and diminished up-regulation of integrin and selectin receptors, which hinders neutrophils' ability to interact with adhesion molecules in the endothelium.",
        "Following India's independence, the Chief Commissioner's Province of Himachal Pradesh was established on April 15, 1948, as a result of the unification of 28 smaller princely states, including the Simla Hills States and four Punjab southern hill states. This integration was facilitated by the Himachal Pradesh (Administration) Order, 1948, which fell under Sections 3 and 4 of the Extra-Provincial Jurisdiction Act, 1947 (later renamed as the Foreign Jurisdiction Act, 1947). The State of Bilaspur was subsequently merged with Himachal Pradesh on April 1, 1954, through the Himachal Pradesh and Bilaspur (New State) Act, 1954. With the implementation of the Constitution of India on January 26, 1950, Himachal Pradesh was reclassified as a part C state.",
        "The term \"Bleacher Bums\" refers to a group of rowdy fans who occupy the bleacher section at Wrigley Field, frequently engaging in loud and boisterous behavior throughout the day. The origin of the name \"Bleacher Bums\" stems from the perception that these fans were unemployed, as they attended almost every game, which were typically daytime events. Interestingly, many of these Bleacher Bums are actually students from local Chicago-area universities, including DePaul, Loyola, Northwestern, and Illinois-Chicago. A popular Broadway play, starring Joe Mantegna, Dennis Farina, Dennis Franz, and James Belushi, was inspired by the antics of these eccentric fans and ran for several years.",
        "At approximately 1:17 pm PDT (20:17 UTC), the torch was ignited at AT&T Park's outdoor location, held briefly by American and Chinese Olympic officials. However, the relay soon descended into chaos when the first runner vanished into a waterfront pier warehouse for about 30 minutes. The situation was further complicated by clashes between thousands of pro-China protesters, many of whom claimed to have been transported by the Chinese Consulate and other pro-China groups, and advocates for Tibet and Darfur. The non-Chinese demonstrators were reportedly overwhelmed and pursued by angry crowds. By 2 pm PDT (21:00 UTC), the torch reappeared around 3 km (1.9 mi) away from the stadium along Van Ness Avenue, a busy street that was not part of the original route plan. Television broadcasts captured images of the flame.",
        "A standard adult football match is divided into two equal periods, each lasting 45 minutes, referred to as halves. The clock runs continuously throughout each half, uninterrupted by stoppages in play. A 15-minute break, known as halftime, separates the two halves. The match concludes at full-time. The referee serves as the official timekeeper, allocating additional time for substitutions, player injuries, and other stoppages. This additional time is often referred to as stoppage time, injury time, or loss time, and is at the referee's discretion. The referee is responsible for signaling the end of the match, although in matches with a fourth official, the referee will indicate the intended stoppage time towards the end of the half, and the fourth official will inform the players and spectators through a visual display.",
        "The identification of an infectious agent is typically only pursued when it can lead to effective treatment, prevention, or a deeper understanding of the disease's progression before therapeutic or preventative measures are developed. For instance, in the early 1980s, when AZT was not yet available to treat AIDS, researchers closely monitored the blood compositions of patients to track the disease's progression, despite not being able to offer additional treatment options. These studies allowed for the advancement of theories on the virus's transmission routes, particularly in specific communities. By understanding how the disease was transmitted, resources could be targeted to high-risk areas, thereby reducing the number of new infections. The specific identification of HIV through serological, genotypic, or molecular methods also enabled researchers to develop hypotheses about the virus's temporal and geographical origins, ultimately informing targeted prevention strategies.",
        "Since gaining independence, Estonia has positioned itself as a bridge between Eastern and Western cultures, actively pursuing economic reforms and integration with the West. Estonia's market-oriented reforms have positioned it among the leading economies in the former COMECON region. In 1994, inspired by Milton Friedman's economic theories, Estonia became one of the first countries to adopt a flat tax system, with a uniform rate of 26% applied to all personal income. Subsequently, the personal income tax rate was reduced to 24% in January 2005, followed by another decrease to 23% in January 2006. By January 2008, the rate was further lowered to 21%. The Estonian government finalized the design of the country's euro coins in late 2004 and adopted the euro as its official currency on January 1, 2011, following a slight delay due to persistent inflationary pressures. Additionally, Estonia levies a Land Value Tax, which is utilized to fund local municipalities. Although it is a state-level tax, the entire revenue generated is allocated to support local councils, with the rate being set by the government.",
        "The island of Saint Helena, spanning 122 km2 (47 sq mi), is primarily characterized by rugged terrain of volcanic origin, with the last volcanic activity dating back around 7 million years. The coastal regions, covered in volcanic rock, exhibit warmer and drier conditions compared to the central areas. The highest point, Diana's Peak, stands at 818 m (2,684 ft), and was declared the island's first national park in 1996. New Zealand flax dominates much of the island, a remnant of former industry, although some original trees remain, supplemented by plantations, including the Millennium Forest project, established in 2002 to replant a portion of the lost Great Wood, now managed by the Saint Helena National Trust. Upon its discovery, the island was teeming with unique indigenous vegetation, including an extraordinary cabbage tree species. It is believed that the island's interior was once a dense tropical forest, while the coastal areas were likely similarly dense, although the exact extent of this is still unknown.",
        "In the mid-1980s, established bands regained their momentum. After an eight-year hiatus, Deep Purple reunited with their classic Machine Head lineup to release Perfect Strangers in 1984, which achieved impressive chart success, reaching number five in the UK and top five in five other countries, while being certified platinum in the US. Van Halen, following somewhat slower sales with their fourth album, Fair Warning, bounced back with the Top 3 album Diver Down in 1982, before reaching their commercial peak with 1984. This album climbed to number two on the Billboard album chart, featuring the hit single \"Jump\", which reached number one on the singles chart and stayed there for several weeks. Meanwhile, Heart, which had struggled during the early 1980s, made a comeback with their eponymous ninth studio album, which debuted at number one and included four Top 10 singles, including their first number one hit.",
        "In the United States, a predominantly two-party system has emerged, with the Republican Party representing conservative ideologies and the Democratic Party embodying liberal views. This dichotomy has been a consistent feature of American politics, dating back to the early days of Federalist and Republican parties. The Republican Party dominated initially, but later split into National Republicans and Democratic Republicans, ultimately giving rise to the Whig and Democratic parties. The Whigs, however, were short-lived, disintegrating over the slavery issue, with some members joining the newly formed Republican Party, while others remained within the Democratic Party. Although third parties, such as the Libertarian Party, typically receive limited support and rarely win elections, there have been instances where they have drawn votes away from major parties, as seen in the cases of Theodore Roosevelt in 1912 and George Wallace in 1968.",
        "Notre Dame underwent significant changes to its conference affiliations in 2013, affecting most sports apart from football and fencing, which will undergo a change in 2014. The university left the Big East and joined the ACC, maintaining its football independence while committing to play five games per season against ACC opponents. The shift was prompted by the Big East's prolonged instability. In ice hockey, Notre Dame was compelled to find a new conference home following the Big Ten's decision to add the sport in 2013-14, which led to the Central Collegiate Hockey Association's dissolution after the 2012-13 season. The university subsequently moved its hockey team to Hockey East. After joining the ACC, the conference announced its intention to add fencing as a sponsored sport, effective from the 2014-15 school year. Despite various theories surrounding the origins of the athletics moniker, it is known that the Fighting Irish name was adopted.",
        "Among the 80 torch-bearers in London, Sir Steve Redgrave, who kick-started the relay, revealed to the media that he had received emails urging him to boycott the event, and acknowledged that he could understand why some would want to make an issue out of it. Notably, Francesca Martinez and Richard Vaughan declined to carry the torch, whereas Konnie Huq chose to proceed with the relay while also voicing her concerns about China. Meanwhile, pro-Tibetan Member of Parliament Norman Baker appealed to all bearers to reconsider their involvement. Amidst the intense pressure from both sides, Prime Minister Gordon Brown welcomed the torch outside 10 Downing Street, but refrained from touching or holding it. The London leg of the relay was accompanied by a \"mobile protective ring,\" as described by the BBC. The event was marred by protests from the outset, resulting in at least thirty-five arrests. During the relay, a demonstrator attempted to snatch the torch from Konnie Huq in a brief scuffle, and a fire extinguisher was also set off near the torch. The Chinese ambassador carried the torch through London's Chinatown afterwards.",
        "Jerusalem holds immense spiritual significance for Jews, Muslims, and Christians, as it is the cradle of sites deeply revered in their respective faiths. The Old City, comprising the Western Wall and the Temple Mount, the Al-Aqsa Mosque, and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, is a testament to this sacred importance. In Israel, other notable religious sites include Nazareth, revered in Christianity as the site of the Annunciation of Mary; Tiberias and Safed, two of the Four Holy Cities in Judaism; the White Mosque in Ramla, a shrine of profound significance in Islam, commemorating the prophet Saleh; and the Church of Saint George in Lod, a sacred location shared by Christianity and Islam, where Saint George or Al Khidr is believed to be buried. Furthermore, the West Bank is home to a multitude of other revered landmarks, including Joseph's Tomb in Nablus, the birthplace of Jesus, and Rachel's Tomb in Bethlehem, among others.",
        "In many cases, non-alphanumeric characters on typewriters were positioned in accordance with their shifted positions on mechanical typewriters, a crucial detail that sets them apart from their electric counterparts. This convention was influenced by the Remington No. 2, the first typewriter featuring a shift key, which was introduced in 1878. Early mechanical typewriters, including the Remington No. 2, did not include the digits 0 and 1, instead using the capital letter \"O\" and lowercase letter \"L\" to represent these numbers. However, once 0 and 1 became more common, the 1! and 0) pairs became standard. As a result, in ASCII, the characters!\"#$% were placed in the second column, rows 1-5, corresponding to the digits 1-5 in the adjacent column. Notably, the parentheses could not be aligned with the characters 9 and 0 due to the space character occupying the position corresponding to 0. To address this, the underscore character was removed from the equation.",
        "The adolescent stage is characterized by a dramatic shift in a young person's role within their family. Initially, children assert themselves strongly, but they lack significant influence over family decisions until early adolescence, when they begin to be regarded by their parents as equals. During this period, adolescents must navigate the delicate balance of increasing independence while maintaining a close, caring relationship with their parents. The onset of puberty often leads to a surge in parent-adolescent conflict and a less cohesive family bond. Disagreements frequently revolve around minor issues of control, such as curfew, acceptable attire, and the adolescent's right to privacy, which may have previously been seen as the exclusive domain of parents. The growing influence of friends on each other also contributes to increased disagreements, as adolescents are exposed to new values and perspectives that may clash with those of their parents. Furthermore, social media has become a significant factor in adolescent and parent disagreements, as parents must now contend with the potential threats and consequences of their child's online activities.",
        "Microbiological culture is a fundamental diagnostic tool for identifying infectious diseases. In this process, a growth medium is provided specifically for a particular microorganism. A sample is then taken from potentially infected tissue or fluid and tested for the presence of an infectious agent that can thrive in that medium. Most pathogenic bacteria can be easily cultivated on nutrient agar, a type of solid medium that supplies essential carbohydrates and proteins for bacterial growth, as well as abundant water. A single bacterium will develop into a visible mound on the plate's surface, referred to as a colony, which may be distinct from other colonies or merge into a uniform \"lawn.\" The size, color, shape, and appearance of a colony are characteristic of the bacterial species, its specific genetic makeup (strain), and the environmental conditions that support its growth. Other additives may be included on the plate to facilitate identification. Plates can also contain substances that enable the growth of specific bacteria.",
        "Around 20% of Eton's student body benefits from financial assistance, courtesy of a variety of bursaries and scholarships. In a recent statement, former Head Master Tony Little revealed that Eton is actively working to make the school accessible to any boy, regardless of his family's income. In 2011, he reported that approximately 250 students received substantial financial support from the institution. By early 2014, this number had increased to 263 pupils, who received school fee assistance equivalent to 60% of the total cost, while an additional 63 students attended the school without incurring any tuition fees. Little aimed to achieve a short-term goal of providing bursaries to around 320 students annually, with 70 pupils receiving their education entirely free of charge. He ultimately intends to see a significant expansion of the school's financial aid programs.",
        "Prior to the formation of Queen, Brian May and Roger Taylor collaborated in the band Smile. During this period, Freddie Mercury, then known as Farrokh \"Freddie\" Bulsara, became a fan and encouraged the duo to explore innovative stage and recording techniques. Mercury eventually joined Smile in 1970, proposed the name \"Queen\" for their new band, and adopted his iconic stage name. John Deacon was recruited before the recording of their debut album, titled Queen, in 1973. Queen initially gained chart success in the UK with their second album, Queen II, in 1974. However, it was the release of Sheer Heart Attack later that year and A Night at the Opera in 1975 that propelled them to international stardom. The latter album featured the groundbreaking hit \"Bohemian Rhapsody,\" which held the number one spot in the UK for nine consecutive weeks and popularized the concept of music videos. Their 1977 album, News of the World, included the enduring anthems \"We Will Rock You\" and \"We Are the Champions,\" which have since become synonymous with sporting events.",
        "On March 13, the port city of Clydebank near Glasgow, Scotland, was subjected to a bombing raid, leaving only seven of its 12,000 houses unscathed. This devastating attack was not an isolated incident, as numerous other British ports came under attack that month. Plymouth, for instance, was hit five times, while Belfast, Hull, and Cardiff were also targeted. The city of Cardiff suffered three consecutive nights of bombing, with Portsmouth's central area being particularly ravaged by five raids. The civilian housing crisis was dire, with an average of 40,000 people being forced to flee their homes each week by September 1940. In March 1941, two major raids on Plymouth and London displaced a staggering 148,000 people. Despite the widespread destruction, British ports continued to play a crucial role in supporting the war effort, with supplies from North America still flowing through them and the Royal Navy maintaining its operations in Plymouth, Southampton, and Portsmouth. Plymouth, situated on the vulnerable south coast and near German air bases, bore the brunt of the attacks. On the night of March 10-11, a massive force of 240 bombers dropped 193 tons of high explosives and 46,000 incendiary devices, resulting in significant damage to residential areas and commercial districts.",
        "The origins of collegiate a cappella are unclear, although the Rensselyrics of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, established in 1873, is likely the oldest known collegiate a cappella group. However, the longest continuously performing group is probably The Whiffenpoofs of Yale University, which was founded in 1909 and boasted Cole Porter as a former member. Collegiate a cappella groups experienced significant growth throughout the 20th century. Notable historical groups that emerged during this time include the Tigertones at Princeton University (1946), The Colgate 13 at Colgate University (1942), the Aires at Dartmouth College (1946), Cayuga's Waiters at Cornell University (1949), The Hangovers at Cornell University (1968), the Maine Steiners at the University of Maine (1958), the Kingsmen at Columbia University (1949), the Jabberwocks at Brown University (1949), and the YellowJackets at the University of Rochester (1956). The all-women a cappella groups followed shortly, often as a parody of the men's groups: the Smiffenpoofs at Smith College (1936), The Shwiffs at Connecticut College (1930s), and other notable groups such as The Amherst College Women's Chorus (1950s) and The University of Pennsylvania's Off the Beat (1980s).",
        "Adolescents' peer groups provide a platform for them to explore their emotions, identity, and social skills. These groups offer opportunities for developing essential social skills, such as empathy, sharing, and leadership. Individuals are drawn to peer groups that mirror their own characteristics, allowing them to feel more comfortable in their own skin. By engaging with their peers, adolescents internalize group norms and values, which in turn shape their self-concept. Through communication with their peers, they develop new skills, reflect on their own opinions and values, and feel more confident in expressing emotions and concerns without fear of rejection or judgment. Peer groups can have a significant impact on an individual's life, influencing their academic motivation and performance. While peers can facilitate social development, they can also hinder it by promoting negative behaviors such as drug use, vandalism, and stealing through peer pressure. Research has shown that susceptibility to peer pressure peaks around age 14 and decreases thereafter. Moreover, the influence of peers on adolescents is a complex phenomenon that warrants further exploration.",
        "Following a period of internal turmoil, the Liberal Party was plagued by a leadership contest between John Howard, the former Treasurer, and Andrew Peacock, the former Foreign Minister. Meanwhile, the Australian economy was grappling with the early 1990s recession, characterized by soaring unemployment rates of 11.4% in 1992. In November 1991, under the leadership of Dr. John Hewson, the opposition launched the comprehensive Fightback! policy document, a 650-page manifesto outlining a radical agenda of economic liberalization. This ambitious plan included the introduction of a Goods and Services Tax, significant reforms to Medicare, a nine-month limit on unemployment benefits, changes to industrial relations, a $13 billion tax cut for middle and upper-income earners, and $10 billion in government spending reductions. The document also proposed the abolition of state payroll taxes, the privatization of numerous government-owned enterprises, and a distinct shift away from the Keynesian economic conservatism that had defined previous Liberal and National Coalition governments, signaling a significant departure from the party's traditional stance.",
        "Scholars of law have scrutinized the depiction of legal issues in Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird, particularly in scenes outside the courtroom. As Claudia Durst Johnson observes, legal scholars have generated a substantial body of critical analysis in law journals, surpassing the literary scholars' output in literary journals. The novel's opening quote from Charles Lamb, a 19th-century essayist, resonates with the theme: \"Lawyers, I suppose, were children once.\" Johnson notes that even in the childhood world of Scout and Jem, compromises and treaties are forged through informal agreements, while legal discussions unfold, such as Atticus and his children debating whether Bob Ewell's hunting and trapping out of season are justifiable. Furthermore, symbolic courtrooms are set up in various social contexts, where norms are challenged. For instance, Mr. Dolphus Raymond has been ostracized by society for his unconventional relationship with a black woman and their interracial children, highlighting the societal codes that are broken and the moral dilemmas that arise from them.",
        "Queen's A Night at the Opera, named after the classic Marx Brothers film, was released in late 1975, boasting the distinction of being the most costly album production at the time. Like its precursor, this album showcases the band's eclectic musical range and innovative use of stereo sound. One notable track is the eight-minute epic \"The Prophet's Song\", which features a captivating canon section, crafted by layering simple phrases to create a rich, choral atmosphere. The poignant ballad \"Love of My Life\", penned by Freddie Mercury, incorporates a harp and lush, overdubbed vocal harmonies. The album received widespread acclaim in the UK, achieving triple platinum status in the US, and in 2004, it ranked 13th in a Channel 4 poll as one of the greatest albums of all time. It has also consistently ranked high in international polls, earning the 19th spot in a Guinness poll and 28th in an ABC poll, with the Australian public voting it one of the greatest albums of all time.",
        "While the doctrine of Mary's Immaculate Conception emerged later among Latin and Frankish theologians, it gained prominence among Byzantine scholars who drew inspiration from Gregory Nazianzen's Mariology in the Medieval East. Although hymn writers and scholars, such as Emperor Justinian I, frequently referred to Mary as \"prepurified\" in their poetic and creedal statements, it was Sophronius of Jerusalem who provided the initial insight into Nazianzen's meaning. In his writings, Sophronius explained that Mary was already immaculate at the Annunciation, when she was \"purified,\" and even went so far as to note that John the Baptist was holier than any other human being born of woman, since Mary's exceptional holiness signified that she was even holier than John after his sanctification in the womb. Sophronius' teachings were later expanded upon and incorporated by St. John Damascene. In addition to numerous passages praising the Theotokos for her purification at the Annunciation, John bestowed upon her the unique honor of \"purifying the waters of baptism by touching them.\"",
        "Along the torch relay route, a series of protests unfolded, with members of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China, including renowned pro-democracy activist Szeto Wah, brandishing inflatable Olympic flames to symbolize democracy. They demanded accountability for the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989 and the implementation of democratic reforms in Hong Kong. Notably, political activist and Legislative Council member Leung Kwok-hung, also known as \"Longhair,\" joined the protest, expressing pride in Hong Kong's courageous individuals who dare to speak out. However, pro-democracy activists were met with a counter-crowd of torch supporters hurling insults such as \"running dog,\" \"traitor,\" \"get out!,\" and \"I love the Communist Party.\" Meanwhile, around 10 members of the Civil Human Rights Front carried orange banners calling for human rights improvements and universal suffrage. Onlookers attempted to cover the banners with a large Chinese national flag, shouting \"Aren't you Chinese?\" in Mandarin. One woman, in particular, stood out as she attempted to resist the attempts to silence her and the other protesters.",
        "Zhejiang Province's primary industrial sectors include electromechanical manufacturing, textiles, chemicals, food processing, and construction materials. The province has adopted a distinct development strategy, known as the \"Zhejiang model,\" which focuses on fostering entrepreneurship, small business growth, and market responsiveness. This approach is characterized by significant public investments in infrastructure and a focus on producing low-cost goods in bulk for both domestic consumption and export. As a result, Zhejiang has emerged as one of China's most affluent provinces, with the \"Zhejiang spirit\" earning a reputation as a benchmark for success. Nevertheless, some economists are now concerned that this model may not be sustainable in the long term, as it is inefficient and places excessive demands on natural resources and public utilities. Moreover, the countless small businesses in Zhejiang producing low-cost goods may struggle to transition to more complex or technologically advanced industries, potentially limiting the province's future growth prospects.",
        "In December, Beyonc\u00e9 joined forces with other celebrities to create a video campaign for \"Demand A Plan\", a bipartisan initiative launched by 950 US mayors to persuade the federal government to reassess its gun control policies in the wake of the Sandy Hook Elementary School tragedy. Prior to this, Beyonc\u00e9 served as an ambassador for the 2012 World Humanitarian Day campaign, contributing her song \"I Was Here\" and its music video, filmed at the UN headquarters, to the cause. In 2013, it was announced that she would collaborate with Salma Hayek and Frida Giannini on Gucci's \"Chime for Change\" campaign, which aimed to promote female empowerment. The campaign, which premiered on February 28, featured Beyonc\u00e9's new music, and a concert event was held in London on June 1, 2013, featuring performances by Ellie Goulding, Florence and the Machine, and Rita Ora. Ahead of the concert, Beyonc\u00e9 appeared in a campaign video released on May 15, 2013, where she and other prominent figures emphasized the importance of the initiative.",
        "Despite offering a range of academic disciplines, including calligraphic arts, oral traditions, and intellectual pursuits, Ottoman madaris primarily functioned as institutions dedicated to spiritual education in the Islamic tradition. As \u0130nalc\u0131k notes, the ultimate goal of knowledge, particularly spiritual sciences, is to gain a deeper understanding of God. In the Ottoman madrasa, the significance and importance of each subject were largely determined by its relevance to Islam. For instance, sciences like astrology were deemed undesirable, while those that supported religious beliefs were valued. Mathematics and logic, although part of the curriculum, were subordinated to religious principles. Interestingly, even mathematical teachings were underpinned by a religious motivation, as the Ulema believed that these subjects helped develop critical thinking and ultimately revealed divine truths. Similarly, philosophy was only permitted within the context of Islamic thought, with \u0130nalc\u0131k noting that it was seen as a means to further explore and understand divine mysteries.",
        "Galicia's earliest human inhabitants date back to the Middle Paleolithic era, while its name originates from the Gallaeci, a Celtic tribe that inhabited the region north of the Douro river during the last millennium before Christ. The Gallaeci's territory roughly corresponded to the Iron Age Castro culture. Following the Cantabrian Wars in 19 BC, Galicia became part of the Roman Empire, eventually being transformed into a Roman province in the 3rd century AD. The Germanic Suebi established a kingdom in Braga, Portugal, in 410, which was later incorporated into the Visigoth kingdom in 585. In 711, the Arabs invaded the Iberian Peninsula, capturing the Visigoth kingdom. However, Galicia was eventually incorporated into the Christian kingdom of Asturias in 740. Throughout the Middle Ages, Galicia's monarchy experienced periods of self-governance, with its own kings ruling on occasion, but often being aligned with the kingdom of Asturias.",
        "Upon its release, Twilight Princess was widely acclaimed by critics, with many regarding it as the best Zelda game ever made. Pundits from publications like 1UP.com, Computer and Video Games, Electronic Gaming Monthly, Game Informer, GamesRadar, IGN, and The Washington Post shared this sentiment. Game Informer lauded the game as \"a creative masterpiece rivaling the best Hollywood has to offer,\" while GamesRadar bestowed upon it \"the absolute highest recommendation.\" Cubed3 proclaimed Twilight Princess \"the single greatest videogame experience\" ever had. The game's visual style and animation received widespread praise, despite being designed for the GameCube, which was technically inferior to the next-generation consoles. Although IGN and GameSpy noted the presence of blurry textures and low-resolution characters, Computer and Video Games felt that the game's atmosphere surpassed that of any previous Zelda game, with PALGN deeming Hyrule the best version ever created. The publication also praised the game's cinematics, stating that \"the cutscenes are the best in the series.\"",
        "The islands of Great Britain and Ireland have diverse topography, with the majority of the terrain lying at relatively low elevations. The lowest point is found in Cambridgeshire, England, with an altitude of -2.75 meters (-9.02 feet). In contrast, the Scottish Highlands in northern Great Britain are characterized by rugged mountains, with Ben Nevis being the highest peak at 1,343 meters (4,406 feet). Other mountainous regions can be found in Wales and parts of Ireland, although only seven peaks exceed 1,000 meters (3,281 feet) in height. The islands' lakes are generally modest in size, with the exception of Lough Neagh in Northern Ireland, which covers an area of 150 square miles (390 km2). Notably, Loch Lomond in Scotland is the largest freshwater body in Great Britain by area, measuring 27.5 square miles (71 km2), while Loch Ness is the largest by volume. Additionally, Loch Morar is the deepest freshwater body in the British Isles, with a maximum depth of 310 meters (1,017 feet).",
        "The aftermath of World War II left a lasting impact on Britain and the empire, as well as the global landscape. The war-ravaged continent of Europe, once a dominant world power, was now a battleground for the armies of the United States and the Soviet Union, who had emerged as global heavyweights. Britain, meanwhile, was on the brink of bankruptcy, only saved by a $US 4.33 billion loan from the United States in 1946, the final installment of which wasn't paid off until 2006. Amidst this turmoil, anti-colonial movements were gaining momentum in European colonies, further complicating the situation. The escalating Cold War rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union added to the complexity, as both nations ostensibly opposed colonialism. However, in reality, the US prioritized anti-communism over anti-imperialism, leading to its support for the continued existence of the British Empire as a means of containing Communist expansion.",
        "According to Homer, the Hellenes were a relatively small tribe inhabiting Thessalic Phthia, with their warriors led by the legendary Achilleus. The Parian Chronicle records that Phthia was the ancestral homeland of the Hellenes, and that this name was bestowed upon those previously known as the Greeks (\u0393\u03c1\u03b1\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03af). In Greek mythology, Hellen, the patriarch of the Hellenes, was the son of Pyrrha and Deucalion, who reigned over Phthia following the great deluge, and were the sole survivors. It appears that this myth was concocted when the Greek tribes began to disperse across various regions of Greece, serving as a testament to their shared origins. Aristotle, in turn, refers to ancient Hellas as an entity that existed prior to the separation of the Greek tribes.",
        "Despite the uncertainty, the Luftwaffe posed a significant threat. The German occupation of Western Europe heightened concerns about intensified submarine and air raids on Britain's maritime connections, which would have far-reaching implications for the war's trajectory if successful. Liverpool, a crucial destination for convoys from North America, served as a vital hub for supplies and resources. The extensive rail network then dispersed these goods throughout the country. The Luftwaffe's attacks on Liverpool during the Blitz were effective. A total of 39,126 long tons of shipping were sunk, with another 111,601 long tons damaged. Minister of Home Security Herbert Morrison was also troubled by the decline in morale, citing civilians' defeatist sentiments. Additionally, reports suggest that half of the port's 144 berths were rendered inoperable, and cargo unloading capacity was reduced by 75%. The attacks blocked roads and railways, leaving ships stranded in harbour. On May 8, 1941, 57 ships were destroyed, exacerbating the city's distress.",
        "During King George V's reign, a significant renovation took place in 1913, when Sir Aston Webb reimagined the East Front, originally designed by Blore in 1850, to resemble Giacomo Leoni's Lyme Park in Cheshire. The newly refaced principal fa\u00e7ade, crafted from Portland stone, served as a striking backdrop for the Victoria Memorial, a large statue of Queen Victoria, situated outside the main gates. Notably, George V's personality differed from his father's; he prioritized official duties and entertaining over extravagant parties. To that end, he organized a series of command performances, featuring notable jazz musicians such as the Original Dixieland Jazz Band (1919), Sidney Bechet, and Louis Armstrong (1932), marking the first jazz performance for a head of state. This endeavor earned the palace a nomination in 2009 for a (Kind of) Blue Plaque by the Brecon Jazz Festival, recognizing its significant contribution to the development of jazz music in the United Kingdom.",
        "The brief respite in European conflicts enabled Napoleon to redirect his attention to France's overseas territories. Following the Revolutionary Wars, Saint-Domingue had achieved a significant degree of autonomy, with Toussaint Louverture assuming the role of de facto leader by 1801. Seizing the opportunity presented by the Treaty of Amiens, Napoleon aimed to regain control of the formerly prosperous colony. During the Revolution, the National Convention had voted to abolish slavery in February 1794. However, under the terms of the Treaty of Amiens, Napoleon agreed to placate British demands by refraining from abolishing slavery in colonies where the 1794 decree had not been implemented. This led to the passage of the Law of 20 May, which restored the slave trade to Caribbean colonies, rather than slavery itself. In response, Napoleon dispatched an expedition under General Leclerc to tackle the situation.",
        "The concept of Mary's sinlessness and exemption from any taint since the moment of her creation was a widely accepted doctrine among Byzantine Greek theologians. Specifically, St. Gregory Nazianzen's explanation of Jesus' and Mary's \"purification\" at the circumcision (Luke 2:22) led him to redefine the term \"purification\" in Christology and Mariology. According to St. Gregory, \"purification\" refers to a sinless nature that was perfected in glory at a moment of divine favor (e.g., Jesus' Baptism). Nazianzen designated Mary as \"prepurified\" (prokathartheisa), suggesting that both Jesus and Mary shared equally holy human natures, which were consequently purified through this divine act. St. Gregory likely employed this doctrine to resolve the paradox of the Purification of Jesus and Mary in the Temple. His ideas surrounding Mary's purification may have been tied to the growing veneration of the Mother of God in and around Constantinople, which coincided with the celebration of Christmas. Nazianzen's title of Mary as \"prepurified\" at the Annunciation was later adopted by others.",
        "Until 1841, the state's close ties with the United States maintained a sense of tranquility, distinct from the rest of the country. However, by 1843, the government anticipated the possibility of war and took proactive measures to fortify its defenses along the Texas border. This included arming the military, optimizing efficiency at presidios, and organizing the Regimen for the Defenders of the Border, comprising light cavalry, four squads of brigades, and a small contingent of 14 men and 42 officials, all at a cost of 160,603 pesos annually. Meanwhile, private citizens attempted to intercept commercial caravans carrying supplies from the United States, but due to their remote location from central Mexico's major suppliers, they were allowed to pass in March 1844. As war seemed increasingly likely, the state legislature issued a decree on July 11, 1846, enlisting 6,000 men for military service.",
        "In the spring of 1800, Napoleon's forces traversed the treacherous Swiss Alps, intent on catching the Austrian armies off guard in Italy. As they entered the Italian plains, they faced minimal resistance, allowing them to establish a strong foothold. Meanwhile, the Austrians were preoccupied with a force besieging Genoa, while a separate army, led by Andr\u00e9 Mass\u00e9na, offered fierce resistance, buying time for the northern French army to regroup. Following a few days of searching for each other, the two armies clashed at the Battle of Marengo on June 14. Despite being outnumbered, with approximately 24,000 French troops compared to the Austrians' 30,000, Napoleon's forces initially fared poorly, with the Austrians launching a successful initial attack that drove them back. However, General Melas eventually concluded that",
        "In Homer's Iliad, the terms Danaans and Argives are employed to refer to the Greek forces engaged in battle against the Trojans. The myth of Danaus, who is said to have originated from Egypt, serves as a foundational legend for the city of Argos. According to myth, his daughters, the Danaides, were condemned to pour water from a jug into a bottomless bathtub in Tartarus, a task that is perpetually unfulfilled. This myth shares a kinship with the legend of Sisyphus, another fabled task that is doomed to remain unfinished. The name \"Danaan\" may be derived from the Proto-Indo-European root \"*danu-\", which means \"river\". Despite extensive scholarly inquiry, no universally accepted theory has emerged to explain the origins of the Danaans. Some researchers have posited a connection between the Danaans and the Denyen, a group of sea peoples who launched a campaign against Egypt during the reign of Pharaoh Ramesses III (1187-1156 BCE). The same inscription also references the Weshesh, who may have been the ancestors of the Achaeans. The Denyen appear to have inhabited the city of Adana in Cilicia. Notably, pottery styles reminiscent of the Danaans have been discovered in the region.",
        "In 1969, Arnold Schwarzenegger's life took a significant turn when he met Barbara Outland, an English teacher, with whom he lived until 1974. In his 1977 memoir, Schwarzenegger candidly reflected on his relationship with Barbara, stating: \"Ultimately, it came down to our vastly different outlooks on life. She sought a straightforward, stable existence, whereas I was a free-spirited individual who detested the idea of a mundane life.\" Barbara Baker, as she later became known, described Schwarzenegger as \"a jovial personality, incredibly charming, adventurous, and athletic\" in her early interactions with him. However, she claimed that as their relationship progressed, he became \"intolerable \u2013 classic narcissism \u2013 the world revolved around him.\" Baker published her memoir, \"Arnold and Me: In the Shadow of the Austrian Oak,\" in 2006, which featured a foreword by Schwarzenegger himself. Although the book presented a sometimes unflattering portrayal of their relationship, Schwarzenegger chose to contribute to the publication and even met with Baker for three hours. Baker revealed in her memoir that she only discovered Schwarzenegger's infidelity after they parted ways, and she described their relationship as tumultuous.",
        "The environment in which adolescents grow up significantly influences their identity formation. Research has predominantly focused on white, middle-class youth, revealing that those from more affluent backgrounds tend to develop their identities more effectively. This period of identity formation is a pivotal stage in an individual's life, and recent studies indicate that the transition to adulthood is now taking place over a longer period than previously observed. As a result, the youth stage, encompassing late adolescence and early adulthood, has gained prominence in the life course. This shift has underscored the importance of various factors in shaping an adolescent's social identity, including commitment, coping mechanisms, and social media. Notably, all these factors are influenced by the environment in which an adolescent grows up. Children from more privileged backgrounds, for instance, are exposed to more opportunities and better circumstances, which can have a lasting impact on their identity development.",
        "Thuringia's landscapes showcase remarkable diversity. The northernmost part of the region is characterized by the Harz mountains, giving way to the Golden Valley, a lush and fertile floodplain surrounding Nordhausen, where the Helme River plays a significant role. The northwestern sector is comprised of the Eichsfeld, a hilly and partially forested region that is the source of the Leine River. The central and northern areas of Thuringia are dominated by the 3,000-square-kilometer Thuringian Basin, a highly fertile and flat region centered around the Unstrut River, which is entirely surrounded by a series of hill chains (listed in a counterclockwise direction from the northwest): D\u00fcn, Hainleite, Windleite, Kyffh\u00e4user, Hohe Schrecke, Schm\u00fccke, Finne, Ettersberg, Steigerwald, Thuringian Forest, H\u00f6rselberge, and Hainich. Within the Basin, smaller hill chains include Fahner H\u00f6he and Heilinger H\u00f6hen. South of the Thuringian Basin lies the region's largest mountain range, marked by the Thuringian Forest to the northwest, the Thuringian Highlands in the middle, and the Franconian Mountains in the south.",
        "The social connections that adolescents forge with their peers, family, and surrounding social circle hold immense significance in their overall social development. As adolescents navigate the nuances of friendship and acquaintanceship, they often become deeply emotionally invested in their relationships. While this emotional investment is not inherently problematic, it can become an issue if friends introduce them to harmful situations, thereby exemplifying the concept of peer pressure. During adolescence, individuals are particularly susceptible to the influence of those they form close bonds with, making this period a critical juncture in their social development. As they begin to exercise greater autonomy in making their own decisions, relationships take on added importance, as they help adolescents comprehend the intricacies of social dynamics. The profound impact of peer relationships during this formative period underscores the vital role they play in shaping an adolescent's social development.",
        "In June 2013, Kanye West and celebrity Kim Kardashian welcomed their first child, North, to the world. Later that year, in October, the couple announced their engagement to widespread media attention. West then started working on his next studio album in November 2013, aiming to release it by mid-2014, with renowned producers Rick Rubin and Q-Tip. In the same month, Adidas announced a new partnership with West, with the debut collection set to premiere the following year. In May 2014, West and Kardashian exchanged vows in a private ceremony in Florence, Italy, with a star-studded guest list. West released the single \"Only One\" featuring Paul McCartney on December 31, 2014, and followed it up with \"FourFiveSeconds\" in January 2015, a collaborative effort with Rihanna and McCartney. Additionally, West appeared on the Saturday Night Live 40th Anniversary Special, premiering a new song titled \"Wolves\" featuring Sia Furler.",
        "Many contemporary rock musicians incorporate mandolins into their music, often opting for single-stringed electric models over traditional double-stringed acoustic mandolins. A notable example is Tim Brennan, the guitarist of the Irish-American punk rock band Dropkick Murphys, who, along with his bandmates, incorporates Celtic instruments like the mandolin, tin whistle, and Great Highland bagpipes into their sound. According to the band, these instruments help achieve the distinctive growling tone they aim for. Notably, the 1991 hit single \"Losing My Religion\" by R.E.M. was driven by guitarist Peter Buck's simple yet effective mandolin riffs, which also appeared in nearly a dozen other songs. Similarly, Luther Dickinson of North Mississippi Allstars and The Black Crowes frequently employs the mandolin, with a notable example being his use of the instrument.",
        "Predators and prey often exist in a cyclical relationship, where one organism serves as food for another. Blue jays, for instance, prey on insects, but they themselves may become prey for cats, snakes, or hawks. A more nuanced way to categorize predators is by their trophic level. Organisms that consume autotrophs, or producers, are referred to as herbivores or primary consumers, while those that feed on heterotrophs, such as animals, are classified as secondary consumers, a type of carnivore. However, there are also tertiary consumers that feed on these carnivores, followed by quartary consumers that consume them, and so on. Due to the limited energy transfer between trophic levels, this hierarchy of predation must eventually terminate, typically within five or six levels, although it may only reach three levels in some cases. For example, a lion that preys upon large herbivores like wildebeest illustrates this concept.",
        "In 680, Ibn al-Zubayr fled Medina and sought refuge in Mecca, while Husayn became aware of the people of Kufa's desire for him to take over, promising their full support. To gauge their sincerity, Husayn dispatched his cousin Muslim bin Agail to verify the situation. Upon learning of this development, Yazid I dispatched Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad, the ruler of Basrah, with explicit instructions to thwart the people of Kufa's plans to rally behind Husayn. Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad succeeded in dispersing the crowd gathered around Muslim bin Agail, capturing him in the process. As Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad's true intentions became clear \u2013 to prevent Husayn from gaining support in Kufa \u2013 Muslim bin Agail requested that a message be sent to Husayn, urging him to abandon his plans to migrate to Kufa. However, Husayn's supporters refused to heed this warning, and Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad continued to exert his influence in the region.",
        "On September 1, 1870, the Battle of Sedan commenced as the Army of Ch\u00e2lons, consisting of 202 infantry battalions, 80 cavalry squadrons, and 564 guns, clashed with the combined Prussian Third and Meuse Armies, which fielded 222 infantry battalions, 186 cavalry squadrons, and 774 guns. General De Wimpffen, commander of the French V Corps in reserve, aimed to launch a joint infantry and cavalry assault against the Prussian XI Corps. However, by 11:00, Prussian artillery took a devastating toll on the French forces, while additional Prussian troops poured onto the battlefield. The French cavalry, led by General Marguerite, launched three daring charges against the Prussian XI Corps, which was concentrated in the nearby village of Floing. Marguerite was fatally wounded during the initial charge, and the subsequent attacks resulted in significant losses without yielding any significant gains. By day's end, with all hope of breaking through the Prussian lines exhausted, the French forces were left reeling."
